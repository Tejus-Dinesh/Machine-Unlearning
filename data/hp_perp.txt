{"text": "M r. and Mrs. Dursley, of number four, Privet Drive, were proud to say that they were perfectly normal, thank you very much. They were the last people you\u2019d expect to be involved in anything strange or mysterious, because they just didn\u2019t hold with such nonsense."}
{"text": "Mr. Dursley was the director of a firm called Grunnings, which made drills. He was a big, beefy man with hardly any neck, although he did have a very large mustache. Mrs. Dursley was thin and blonde and had nearly twice the usual amount of neck, which came in very useful as she spent so much of her time craning over garden fences, spying on the neighbors. The Dursleys had a small son called Dudley and in their opinion there was no finer boy anywhere."}
{"text": "The Dursleys had everything they wanted, but they also had a secret, and their greatest fear was that somebody would discover it. They didn\u2019t think they could bear it if anyone found out about the Potters. Mrs. Potter was Mrs. Dursley\u2019s sister, but they hadn\u2019t met for several years; in fact, Mrs. Dursley pretended she didn\u2019t have a sister, because her sister and her good-for-nothing husband were as unDursleyish as it was possible to be. The Dursleys shuddered to think what the neighbors would say if the Potters arrived in the street. The Dursleys knew that the Potters had a small son, too, but they had never even seen him. This boy was another good reason for keeping the Potters away; they didn\u2019t want Dudley mixing with a child like that."}
{"text": "When Mr. and Mrs. Dursley woke up on the dull, gray Tuesday our story starts, there was nothing about the cloudy sky outside to suggest that strange and mysterious things would soon be happening all over the country. Mr. Dursley hummed as he picked out his most boring tie for work, and Mrs. Dursley gossiped away happily as she wrestled a screaming Dudley into his high chair."}
{"text": "None of them noticed a large, tawny owl flutter past the window."}
{"text": "At half past eight, Mr. Dursley picked up his briefcase, pecked Mrs. Dursley on the cheek, and tried to kiss Dudley good-bye but missed, because Dudley was now having a tantrum and throwing his cereal at the walls."}
{"text": "\u201cLittle tyke,\u201d chortled Mr. Dursley as he left the house. He got into his car and backed out of number four\u2019s drive."}
{"text": "It was on the corner of the street that he noticed the first sign of something peculiar \u2014 a cat reading a map. For a second, Mr. Dursley didn\u2019t realize what he had seen \u2014 then he jerked his head around to look again. There was a tabby cat standing on the corner of Privet Drive, but there wasn\u2019t a map in sight. What could he have been thinking of? It must have been a trick of the light. Mr. Dursley blinked and stared at the cat. It stared back. As Mr. Dursley drove around the corner and up the road, he watched the cat in his mirror. It was now reading the sign that said Privet Drive \u2014 no, looking at the sign; cats couldn\u2019t read maps or signs. Mr. Dursley gave himself a little shake and put the cat out of his mind. As he drove toward town he thought of nothing except a large order of drills he was hoping to get that day."}
{"text": "But on the edge of town, drills were driven out of his mind by something else. As he sat in the usual morning traffic jam, he couldn\u2019t help noticing that there seemed to be a lot of strangely dressed people about. People in cloaks. Mr. Dursley couldn\u2019t bear people who dressed in funny clothes \u2014 the getups you saw on young people! He supposed this was some stupid new fashion. He drummed his fingers on the steering wheel and his eyes fell on a huddle of these weirdos standing quite close by. They were whispering excitedly together. Mr. Dursley was enraged to see that a couple of them weren\u2019t young at all; why, that man had to be older than he was, and wearing an emerald-green cloak! The nerve of him! But then it struck Mr. Dursley that this was probably some silly stunt \u2014these people were obviously collecting for something\u2026yes, that would be it. The traffic moved on and a few minutes later, Mr. Dursley arrived in the Grunnings parking lot, his mind back on drills."}
{"text": "Mr. Dursley always sat with his back to the window in his office on the ninth floor. If he hadn\u2019t, he might have found it harder to concentrate on drills that morning. He didn\u2019t see the owls swooping past in broad daylight, though people down in the street did; they pointed and gazed open-mouthed as owl after owl sped overhead. Most of them had never seen an owl even at nighttime. Mr. Dursley, however, had a perfectly normal, owl-free morning. He yelled at five different people. He made several important telephone calls and shouted a bit more. He was in a very good mood until lunchtime, when he thought he\u2019d stretch his legs and walk across the road to buy himself a bun from the bakery."}
{"text": "He\u2019d for gotten all about the people in cloaks until he passed a group of them next to the baker\u2019s. He eyed them angrily as he passed. He didn\u2019t know why, but they made him uneasy. This bunch were whispering excitedly, too, and he couldn\u2019t see a single collecting tin. It was on his way back past them, clutching a large doughnut in a bag, that he caught a few words of what they were saying."}
{"text": "\u201cThe Potters, that\u2019s right, that\u2019s what I heard \u2014\u201d"}
{"text": "\u201c \u2014 yes, their son, Harry \u2014\u201d"}
{"text": "Mr. Dursley stopped dead. Fear flooded him. He looked back at the whisperers as if he wanted to say something to them, but thought better of it."}
{"text": "He dashed back across the road, hurried up to his office, snapped at his secretary not to disturb him, seized his telephone, and had almost finished dialing his home number when he changed his mind. He put the receiver back down and stroked his mustache, thinking\u2026no, he was being stupid. Potter wasn\u2019t such an unusual name. He was sure there were lots of people called Potter who had a son called Harry. Come to think of it, he wasn\u2019t even sure his nephew was called Harry. He\u2019d never even seen the boy. It might have been Harvey. Or Harold. There was no point in worrying Mrs. Dursley; she always got so upset at any mention of her sister. He didn\u2019t blame her \u2014 if he\u2019d had a sister like that\u2026but all the same, those people in cloaks.\u2026"}
{"text": "He found it a lot harder to concentrate on drills that afternoon and when he left the building at five o\u2019clock, he was still so worried that he walked straight into someone just outside the door."}
{"text": "\u201cSorry,\u201d he grunted, as the tiny old man stumbled and almost fell. It was a few seconds before Mr. Dursley realized that the man was wearing a violet cloak. He didn\u2019t seem at all upset at being almost knocked to the ground. On the contrary, his face split into a wide smile and he said in a squeaky voice that made passersby stare, \u201cDon\u2019t be sorry, my dear sir, for nothing could upset me today! Rejoice, for You-Know-Who has gone at last! Even Muggles like yourself should be celebrating, this happy, happy day!\u201d"}
{"text": "And the old man hugged Mr. Dursley around the middle and walked off."}
{"text": "Mr. Dursley stood rooted to the spot. He had been hugged by a complete stranger. He also thought he had been called a Muggle, whatever that was. He was rattled. He hurried to his car and set off for home, hoping he was imagining things, which he had never hoped before, because he didn\u2019t approve of imagination."}
{"text": "As he pulled into the driveway of number four, the first thing he saw \u2014 and it didn\u2019t improve his mood \u2014 was the tabby cat he\u2019d spotted that morning. It was now sitting on his garden wall. He was sure it was the same one; it had the same markings around its eyes."}
{"text": "\u201cShoo!\u201d said Mr. Dursley loudly."}
{"text": "The cat didn\u2019t move. It just gave him a stern look. Was this normal cat behavior? Mr. Dursley wondered. Trying to pull himself together, he let himself into the house. He was still determined not to mention anything to his wife."}
{"text": "Mrs. Dursley had had a nice, normal day. She told him over dinner all about Mrs. Next Door\u2019s problems with her daughter and how Dudley had learned a new word (\u201cWon\u2019t!\u201d). Mr. Dursley tried to act normally. When Dudley had been put to bed, he went into the living room in time to catch the last report on the evening news:"}
{"text": "\u201cAnd finally, bird-watchers everywhere have reported that the nation\u2019s owls have been behaving very unusually today. Although owls normally hunt at night and are hardly ever seen in daylight, there have been hundreds of sightings of these birds flying in every direction since sunrise. Experts are unable to explain why the owls have suddenly changed their sleeping pattern.\u201d The newscaster allowed himself a grin. \u201cMost mysterious. And now, over to Jim McGuffin with the weather. Going to be any more showers of owls tonight, Jim?\u201d"}
{"text": "\u201cWell, Ted,\u201d said the weatherman, \u201cI don\u2019t know about that, but it\u2019s not only the owls that have been acting oddly today. Viewers as far apart as Kent, Yorkshire, and Dundee have been phoning in to tell me that instead of the rain I promised yesterday, they\u2019ve had a downpour of shooting stars! Perhaps people have been celebrating Bonfire Night early \u2014 it\u2019s not until next week, folks! But I can promise a wet night tonight.\u201d"}
{"text": "Mr. Dursley sat frozen in his armchair. Shooting stars all over Britain? Owls flying by daylight? Mysterious people in cloaks all over the place? And a whisper, a whisper about the Potters.\u2026"}
{"text": "Mrs. Dursley came into the living room carrying two cups of tea. It was no good. He\u2019d have to say something to her. He cleared his throat nervously. \u201cEr \u2014 Petunia, dear \u2014 you haven\u2019t heard from your sister lately, have you?\u201d"}
{"text": "As he had expected, Mrs. Dursley looked shocked and angry. After all, they normally pretended she didn\u2019t have a sister."}
{"text": "\u201cNo,\u201d she said sharply. \u201cWhy?\u201d"}
{"text": "\u201cFunny stuff on the news,\u201d Mr. Dursley mumbled. \u201cOwls\u2026shooting stars\u2026and there were a lot of funny-looking people in town today.\u2026\u201d"}
{"text": "\u201cSo?\u201d snapped Mrs. Dursley."}
{"text": "\u201cWell, I just thought\u2026maybe\u2026it was something to do with\u2026you know\u2026her crowd.\u201d"}
{"text": "Mrs. Dursley sipped her tea through pursed lips. Mr. Dursley wondered whether he dared tell her he\u2019d heard the name \u201cPotter.\u201d He decided he didn\u2019t dare. Instead he said, as casually as he could, \u201cTheir son \u2014 he\u2019d be about Dudley\u2019s age now, wouldn\u2019t he?\u201d"}
{"text": "\u201cI suppose so,\u201d said Mrs. Dursley stiffly."}
{"text": "\u201cWhat\u2019s his name again? Howard, isn\u2019t it?\u201d"}
{"text": "\u201cHarry. Nasty, common name, if you ask me.\u201d"}
{"text": "\u201cOh, yes,\u201d said Mr. Dursley, his heart sinking horribly. \u201cYes, I quite agree.\u201d"}
{"text": "He didn\u2019t say another word on the subject as they went upstairs to bed. While Mrs. Dursley was in the bathroom, Mr. Dursley crept to the bedroom window and peered down into the front garden. The cat was still there. It was staring down Privet Drive as though it were waiting for something."}
{"text": "Was he imagining things? Could all this have anything to do with the Potters? If it did...if it got out that they were related to a pair of \u2014 well, he didn\u2019t think he could bear it."}
{"text": "The Dursleys got into bed. Mrs. Dursley fell asleep quickly but Mr. Dursley lay awake, turning it all over in his mind. His last, comforting thought before he fell asleep was that even if the Potters were involved, there was no reason for them to come near him and Mrs. Dursley. The Potters knew very well what he and Petunia thought about them and their kind....He couldn\u2019t see how he and Petunia could get mixed up in anything that might be going on \u2014 he yawned and turned over \u2014 it couldn\u2019t affect them.\u2026"}
{"text": "How very wrong he was."}
{"text": "Mr. Dursley might have been drifting into an uneasy sleep, but the cat on the wall outside was showing no sign of sleepiness. It was sitting as still as a statue, its eyes fixed unblinkingly on the far corner of Privet Drive. It didn\u2019t so much as quiver when a car door slammed on the next street, nor when two owls swooped overhead. In fact, it was nearly midnight before the cat moved at all."}
{"text": "A man appeared on the corner the cat had been watching, appeared so suddenly and silently you\u2019d have thought he\u2019d just popped out of the ground. The cat\u2019s tail twitched and its eyes narrowed."}
{"text": "Nothing like this man had ever been seen on Privet Drive. He was tall, thin, and very old, judging by the silver of his hair and beard, which were both long enough to tuck into his belt. He was wearing long robes, a purple cloak that swept the ground, and high-heeled, buckled boots. His blue eyes were light, bright, and sparkling behind half-moon spectacles and his nose was very long and crooked, as though it had been broken at least twice. This man\u2019s name was Albus Dumbledore."}
{"text": "Albus Dumbledore didn\u2019t seem to realize that he had just arrived in a street where everything from his name to his boots was unwelcome. He was busy rummaging in his cloak, looking for something. But he did seem to realize he was being watched, because he looked up suddenly at the cat, which was still staring at him from the other end of the street. For some reason, the sight of the cat seemed to amuse him. He chuckled and muttered, \u201cI should have known.\u201d"}
{"text": "He found what he was looking for in his inside pocket. It seemed to be a silver cigarette lighter. He flicked it open, held it up in the air, and clicked it. The nearest street lamp went out with a little pop. He clicked it again \u2014 the next lamp flickered into darkness. Twelve times he clicked the Put-Outer, until the only lights left on the whole street were two tiny pinpricks in the distance, which were the eyes of the cat watching him. If anyone looked out of their window now, even beady-eyed Mrs. Dursley, they wouldn\u2019t be able to see anything that was happening down on the pavement. Dumbledore slipped the Put-Outer back inside his cloak and set off down the street toward number four, where he sat down on the wall next to the cat. He didn\u2019t look at it, but after a moment he spoke to it."}
{"text": "\u201cFancy seeing you here, Professor McGonagall.\u201d"}
{"text": "He turned to smile at the tabby, but it had gone. Instead he was smiling at a rather severe-looking woman who was wearing square glasses exactly the shape of the markings the cat had had around its eyes. She, too, was wearing a cloak, an emerald one. Her black hair was drawn into a tight bun. She looked distinctly ruffled."}
{"text": "\u201cHow did you know it was me?\u201d she asked."}
{"text": "\u201cMy dear Professor, I\u2019ve never seen a cat sit so stiffly.\u201d"}
{"text": "\u201cYou\u2019d be stiff if you\u2019d been sitting on a brick wall all day,\u201d said Professor McGonagall."}
{"text": "\u201cAll day? When you could have been celebrating? I must have passed a dozen feasts and parties on my way here.\u201d"}
{"text": "Professor McGonagall sniffed angrily."}
{"text": "\u201cOh yes, I\u2019ve celebrating, all right,\u201d she said impatiently. \u201cYou\u2019d think they\u2019d be a bit more careful, but no \u2014even the Muggles have noticed something\u2019s going on. It was on their news.\u201d She jerked her head back at the Dursleys\u2019 dark living-room window. \u201cI heard it. Flocks of owls\u2026shooting stars\u2026Well, they\u2019re not completely stupid. They were bound to notice something. Shooting stars down in Kent \u2014 I\u2019ll bet that was Dedalus Diggle. He never had much sense.\u201d"}
{"text": "\u201cYou can\u2019t blame them,\u201d said Dumbledore gently. \u201cWe\u2019ve had precious little to celebrate for eleven years.\u201d"}
{"text": "\u201cI know that,\u201d said Professor McGonagall irritably. \u201cBut that\u2019s no reason to lose our heads. People are being downright careless, out on the streets in broad daylight, not even dressed in Muggle clothes, swapping rumors.\u201d"}
{"text": "She threw a sharp, sideways glance at Dumbledore here, as though hoping he was going to tell her something, but he didn\u2019t, so she went on. \u201cA fine thing it would be if, on the very day You-Know-Who seems to have disappeared at last, the Muggles found out about us all. I suppose he really has gone, Dumbledore?\u201d"}
{"text": "\u201cIt certainly seems so,\u201d said Dumbledore. \u201cWe have much to be thankful for. Would you care for a lemon drop?\u201d"}
{"text": "\u201cA what?\u201d"}
{"text": "\u201cA lemon drop. They\u2019re a kind of Muggle sweet I\u2019m rather fond of.\u201d"}
{"text": "\u201cNo, thank you,\u201d said Professor McGonagall coldly, as though she didn\u2019t think this was the moment for lemon drops. \u201cAs I say, even if You-Know-Who has gone \u2014\u201d"}
{"text": "\u201cMy dear Professor, surely a sensible person like yourself can call him by his name? All this \u2018You-Know-Who\u2019 nonsense \u2014 for eleven years I have been trying to persuade people to call him by his proper name: Voldemort.\u201d Professor McGonagall flinched, but Dumbledore, who was unsticking two lemon drops, seemed not to notice. \u201cIt all gets so confusing if we keep saying \u2018You-Know-Who.\u2019 I have never seen any reason to be frightened of saying Voldemort\u2019s name.\u201d"}
{"text": "\u201cI know you haven\u2019t, said Professor McGonagall, sounding half exasperated, half admiring. \u201cBut you\u2019re different. Everyone knows you\u2019re the only one You-Know- oh, all right, Voldemort, was frightened of.\u201d"}
{"text": "\u201cYou flatter me,\u201d said Dumbledore calmly. \u201cVoldemort had powers I will never have.\u201d"}

{"text": "Professor McGonagall shot a sharp look at Dumbledore and said \u201cThe owls are nothing next to the rumors that are flying around. You know what they\u2019re saying? About why he\u2019s disappeared? About what finally stopped him?\u201d"}
{"text": "It seemed that Professor McGonagall had reached the point she was most anxious to discuss, the real reason she had been waiting on a cold, hard wall all day, for neither as a cat nor as a woman had she fixed Dumbledore with such a piercing stare as she did now. It was plain that whatever \u201ceveryone\u201d was saying, she was not going to believe it until Dumbledore told her it was true. Dumbledore, however, was choosing another lemon drop and did not answer."}

He couldn\u2019t kill that little boy. No one knows why, or how, but they\u2019re saying that when he couldn\u2019t kill Harry Potter, Voldemort\u2019s power somehow broke \u2014 and that\u2019s why he\u2019s gone.\u201d"}

It was a very odd watch. It had twelve hands but no numbers; instead, little planets were moving around the edge. It must have made sense to Dumbledore, though, because he put it back in his pocket and said, \u201cHagrid\u2019s late. I suppose it was he who told you I\u2019d be here, by the way?\u201d"}

He laid Harry gently on the doorstep, took a letter out of his cloak, tucked it inside Harry\u2019s blankets, and then came back to the other two.

{"text": "N early ten years had passed since the Dursleys had woken up to find their nephew on the front step, but Privet Drive had hardly changed at all. The sun rose on the same tidy front gardens and lit up the brass number four on the Dursleys\u2019 front door; it crept into their living room, which was almost exactly the same as it had been on the night when Mr. Dursley had seen that fateful news report about the owls. Only the photographs on the mantelpiece really showed how much time had passed. Ten years ago, there had been lots of pictures of what looked like a large pink beach ball wearing different-colored bonnets \u2014 but Dudley Dursley was no longer a baby, and now the photographs showed a large blond boy riding his first bicycle, on a carousel at the fair, playing a computer game with his father, being hugged and kissed by his mother. The room held no sign at all that another boy lived in the house, too."}
{"text": "Yet Harry Potter was still there, asleep at the moment, but not for long. His Aunt Petunia was awake and it was her shrill voice that made the first noise of the day."}

{"text": "Harry woke with a start. His aunt rapped on the door again."}
{"text": "\u201cUp!\u201d she screeched. Harry heard her walking toward the kitchen and then the sound of the frying pan being put on the stove. He rolled onto his back and tried to remember the dream he had been having. It had been a good one. There had been a flying motorcycle in it. He had a funny feeling he\u2019d had the same dream before."}

{"text": "Dudley\u2019s birthday \u2014 how could he have forgotten? Harry got slowly out of bed and started looking for socks. He found a pair under his bed and, after pulling a spider off one of them, put them on. Harry was used to spiders, because the cupboard under the stairs was full of them, and that was where he slept."}
{"text": "When he was dressed he went down the hall into the kitchen. The table was almost hidden beneath all Dudley\u2019s birthday presents. It looked as though Dudley had gotten the new computer he wanted, not to mention the second television and the racing bike. Exactly why Dudley wanted a racing bike was a mystery to Harry, as Dudley was very fat and hated exercise \u2014 unless of course it involved punching somebody. Dudley\u2019s favorite punching bag was Harry, but he couldn\u2019t often catch him. Harry didn\u2019t look it, but he was very fast."}
{"text": "Perhaps it had something to do with living in a dark cupboard, but Harry had always been small and skinny for his age. He looked even smaller and skinnier than he really was because all he had to wear were old clothes of Dudley\u2019s, and Dudley was about four times bigger than he was. Harry had a thin face, knobbly knees, black hair, and bright green eyes. He wore round glasses held together with a lot of Scotch tape because of all the times Dudley had punched him on the nose. The only thing Harry liked about his own appearance was a very thin scar on his forehead that was shaped like a bolt of lightning. He had had it as long as he could remember, and the first question he could ever remember asking his Aunt Petunia was how he had gotten it."}
{"text": "\u201cIn the car crash when your parents died,\u201d she had said. \u201cAnd don\u2019t ask questions.\u201d"}

{"text": "Uncle Vernon entered the kitchen as Harry was turning over the bacon."}
{"text": "\u201cComb your hair!\u201d he barked, by way of a morning greeting."}
{"text": "About once a week, Uncle Vernon looked over the top of his newspaper and shouted that Harry needed a haircut. Harry must have had more haircuts than the rest of the boys in his class put together, but it made no difference, his hair simply grew that way \u2014 all over the place."}
{"text": "Harry was frying eggs by the time Dudley arrived in the kitchen with his mother. Dudley looked a lot like Uncle Vernon. He had a large pink face, not much neck, small, watery blue eyes, and thick blond hair that lay smoothly on his thick, fat head. Aunt Petunia often said that Dudley looked like a baby angel \u2014 Harry often said that Dudley looked like a pig in a wig."}
{"text": "Harry put the plates of egg and bacon on the table, which was difficult as there wasn\u2019t much room. Dudley, meanwhile, was counting his presents. His face fell."}

{"text": "\u201cAll right, thirty-seven then,\u201d said Dudley, going red in the face. Harry, who could see a huge Dudley tantrum coming on, began wolfing down his bacon as fast as possible in case Dudley turned the table over."}
{"text": "Aunt Petunia obviously scented danger, too, because she said quickly, \u201cAnd we\u2019ll buy you another two presents while we\u2019re out today. How\u2019s that, popkin? Two more presents. Is that all right\u201d"}
{"text": "Dudley thought for a moment. It looked like hard work. Finally he said slowly, \u201cSo I\u2019ll have thirty...thirty...\u201d"}
{"text": "\u201cThirty-nine, sweetums,\u201d said Aunt Petunia."}
{"text": "\u201cOh.\u201d Dudley sat down heavily and grabbed the nearest parcel. \u201cAll right then.\u201d"}
{"text": "Uncle Vernon chuckled."}
{"text": "\u201cLittle tyke wants his money\u2019s worth, just like his father. \u2019Atta boy, Dudley!\u201d He ruffled Dudley\u2019s hair."}
{"text": "At that moment the telephone rang and Aunt Petunia went to answer it while Harry and Uncle Vernon watched Dudley unwrap the racing bike, a video camera, a remote control airplane, sixteen new computer games, and a VCR. He was ripping the paper off a gold wristwatch when Aunt Petunia came back from the telephone looking both angry and worried."}
{"text": "\u201cBad news, Vernon,\u201d she said. \u201cMrs. Figg\u2019s broken her leg. She can\u2019t take him.\u201d She jerked her head in Harry\u2019s direction."}
{"text": "Dudley\u2019s mouth fell open in horror, but Harry\u2019s heart gave a leap. Every year on Dudley\u2019s birthday, his parents took him and a friend out for the day, to adventure parks, hamburger restaurants, or the movies. Every year, Harry was left behind with Mrs. Figg, a mad old lady who lived two streets away. Harry hated it there. The whole house smelled of cabbage and Mrs. Figg made him look at photographs of all the cats she\u2019d ever owned."}
{"text": "\u201cNow what?\u201d said Aunt Petunia, looking furiously at Harry as though he\u2019d planned this. Harry knew he ought to feel sorry that Mrs. Figg had broken her leg, but it wasn\u2019t easy when he reminded himself it would be a whole year before he had to look at Tibbles, Snowy, Mr. Paws, and Tufty again."}
{"text": "\u201cWe could phone Marge,\u201d Uncle Vernon suggested."}
{"text": "\u201cDon\u2019t be silly, Vernon, she hates the boy.\u201d"}
{"text": "The Dursleys often spoke about Harry like this, as though he wasn\u2019t there \u2014 or rather, as though he was something very nasty that couldn\u2019t understand them, like a slug."}

{"text": "\u201cOn vacation in Majorca,\u201d snapped Aunt Petunia."}

{"text": "\u201cI won\u2019t blow up the house,\u201d said Harry, but they weren\u2019t listening."}
{"text": "\u201cI suppose we could take him to the zoo,\u201d said Aunt Petunia slowly, \u201c\u2026and leave him in the car.\u2026\u201d"}
{"text": "\u201cThat car\u2019s new, he\u2019s not sitting in it alone.\u2026\u201d"}
{"text": "Dudley began to cry loudly. In fact, he wasn\u2019t really crying \u2014 it had been years since he\u2019d really cried \u2014 but he knew that if he screwed up his face and wailed, his mother would give him anything he wanted."}
{"text": "\u201cDinky Duddydums, don\u2019t cry, Mummy won\u2019t let him spoil your special day!\u201d she cried, flinging her arms around him."}
{"text": "\u201cI\u2026don\u2019t\u2026want\u2026him\u2026t-t-to come!\u201d Dudley yelled between huge, pretend sobs. \u201cHe always sp-spoils everything!\u201d He shot Harry a nasty grin through the gap in his mother\u2019s arms."}
{"text": "Just then, the doorbell rang \u2014 \u201cOh, good Lord, they\u2019re here!\u201d said Aunt Petunia frantically \u2014 and a moment later, Dudley\u2019s best friend, Piers Polkiss, walked in with his mother. Piers was a scrawny boy with a face like a rat. He was usually the one who held people\u2019s arms behind their backs while Dudley hit them. Dudley stopped pretending to cry at once."}
{"text": "Half an hour later, Harry, who couldn\u2019t believe his luck, was sitting in the back of the Dursleys\u2019 car with Piers and Dudley, on the way to the zoo for the first time in his life. His aunt and uncle hadn\u2019t been able to think of anything else to do with him, but before they\u2019d left, Uncle Vernon had taken Harry aside."}
{"text": "\u201cI\u2019m warning you,\u201d he had said, putting his large purple face right up close to Harry\u2019s, \u201cI\u2019m warning you now, boy \u2014 any funny business, anything at all \u2014 and you\u2019ll be in that cupboard from now until Christmas.\u201d"}
{"text": "\u201cI\u2019m not going to do anything,\u201d said Harry, \u201chonestly\u2026\u201d"}
{"text": "But Uncle Vernon didn\u2019t believe him. No one ever did."}
{"text": "The problem was, strange things often happened around Harry and it was just no good telling the Dursleys he didn\u2019t make them happen."}
{"text": "Once, Aunt Petunia, tired of Harry coming back from the barbers looking as though he hadn\u2019t been at all, had taken a pair of kitchen scissors and cut his hair so short he was almost bald except for his bangs, which she left \u201cto hide that horrible scar.\u201d Dudley had laughed himself silly at Harry, who spent a sleepless night imagining school the next day, where he was already laughed at for his baggy clothes and taped glasses. Next morning, however, he had gotten up to find his hair exactly as it had been before Aunt Petunia had sheared it off He had been given a week in his cupboard for this, even though he had tried to explain that he couldn\u2019t explain how it had grown back so quickly."}
{"text": "Another time, Aunt Petunia had been trying to force him into a revolting old sweater of Dudley\u2019s (brown with orange puff balls). The harder she tried to pull it over his head, the smaller it seemed to become, until finally it might have fitted a hand puppet, but certainly wouldn\u2019t fit Harry. Aunt Petunia had decided it must have shrunk in the wash and, to his great relief, Harry wasn\u2019t punished."}
{"text": "On the other hand, he\u2019d gotten into terrible trouble for being found on the roof of the school kitchens. Dudley\u2019s gang had been chasing him as usual when, as much to Harry\u2019s surprise as anyone else\u2019s, there he was sitting on the chimney. The Dursleys had received a very angry letter from Harry\u2019s headmistress telling them Harry had been climbing school buildings. But all he\u2019d tried to do (as he shouted at Uncle Vernon through the locked door of his cupboard) was jump behind the big trash cans outside the kitchen doors. Harry supposed that the wind must have caught him in mid-jump."}
{"text": "But today, nothing was going to go wrong. It was even worth being with Dudley and Piers to be spending the day somewhere that wasn\u2019t school, his cupboard, or Mrs. Figg\u2019s cabbage-smelling living room."}
{"text": "While he drove, Uncle Vernon complained to Aunt Petunia. He liked to complain about things: people at work, Harry, the council, Harry, the bank, and Harry were just a few of his favorite subjects. This morning, it was motorcycles."}
{"text": "\u201c\u2026roaring along like maniacs, the young hoodlums,\u201d he said, as a motorcycle overtook them."}
{"text": "\u201cI had a dream about a motorcycle,\u201d said Harry, remembering suddenly. \u201cIt was flying.\u201d"}
{"text": "Uncle Vernon nearly crashed into the car in front. He turned right around in his seat and yelled at Harry, his face like a gigantic beet with a mustache: \u201cMOTORCYCLES DON\u2019T FLY!\u201d"}
{"text": "Dudley and Piers sniggered."}
{"text": "\u201cI know they don\u2019t,\u201d said Harry. \u201cIt was only a dream.\u201d"}
{"text": "But he wished he hadn\u2019t said anything. If there was one thing the Dursleys hated even more than his asking questions, it was his talking about anything acting in a way it shouldn\u2019t, no matter if it was in a dream or even a cartoon \u2014 they seemed to think he might get dangerous ideas."}
{"text": "It was a very sunny Saturday and the zoo was crowded with families. The Dursleys bought Dudley and Piers large chocolate ice creams at the entrance and then, because the smiling lady in the van had asked Harry what he wanted before they could hurry him away, they bought him a cheap lemon ice pop. It wasn\u2019t bad, either, Harry thought, licking it as they watched a gorilla scratching its head who looked remarkably like Dudley, except that it wasn\u2019t blond."}
{"text": "Harry had the best morning he\u2019d had in a long time. He was careful to walk a little way apart from the Dursleys so that Dudley and Piers, who were starting to get bored with the animals by lunchtime, wouldn\u2019t fall back on their favorite hobby of hitting him. They ate in the zoo restaurant, and when Dudley had a tantrum because his knickerbocker glory didn\u2019t have enough ice cream on top, Uncle Vernon bought him another one and Harry was allowed to finish the first."}
{"text": "Harry felt, afterward, that he should have known it was all too good to last."}
{"text": "After lunch they went to the reptile house. It was cool and dark in there, with lit windows all along the walls. Behind the glass, all sorts of lizards and snakes were crawling and slithering over bits of wood and stone. Dudley and Piers wanted to see huge, poisonous cobras and thick, man-crushing pythons. Dudley quickly found the largest snake in the place. It could have wrapped its body twice around Uncle Vernon\u2019s car and crushed it into a trash can \u2014 but at the moment it didn\u2019t look in the mood. In fact, it was fast asleep."}
{"text": "Dudley stood with his nose pressed against the glass, staring at the glistening brown coils."}
{"text": "\u201cMake it move,\u201d he whined at his father. Uncle Vernon tapped on the glass, but the snake didn\u2019t budge."}
{"text": "\u201cDo it again,\u201d Dudley ordered. Uncle Vernon rapped the glass smartly with his knuckles, but the snake just snoozed on."}
{"text": "\u201cThis is boring,\u201d Dudley moaned. He shuffled away."}
{"text": "Harry moved in front of the tank and looked intently at the snake. He wouldn\u2019t have been surprised if it had died of boredom itself \u2014 no company except stupid people drumming their fingers on the glass trying to disturb it all day long. It was worse than having a cupboard as a bedroom, where the only visitor was Aunt Petunia hammering on the door to wake you up; at least he got to visit the rest of the house."}
{"text": "The snake suddenly opened its beady eyes. Slowly, very slowly, it raised its head until its eyes were on a level with Harry\u2019s."}
{"text": "It winked."}
{"text": "Harry stared. Then he looked quickly around to see if anyone was watching. They weren\u2019t. He looked back at the snake and winked, too."}
{"text": "The snake jerked its head toward Uncle Vernon and Dudley, then raised its eyes to the ceiling. It gave Harry a look that said quite plainly:"}
{"text": "\u201cI get that all the time.\u201d"}
{"text": "\u201cI know,\u201d Harry murmured through the glass, though he wasn\u2019t sure the snake could hear him. \u201cIt must be really annoying.\u201d"}
{"text": "The snake nodded vigorously."}
{"text": "\u201cWhere do you come from, anyway?\u201d Harry asked."}
{"text": "The snake jabbed its tail at a little sign next to the glass. Harry peered at it."}
{"text": "Boa Constrictor, Brazil."}
{"text": "\u201cWas it nice there?\u201d"}
{"text": "The boa constrictor jabbed its tail at the sign again and Harry read on: This specimen was bred in the zoo. \u201cOh, I see \u2014 so you\u2019ve never been to Brazil?\u201d"}
{"text": "As the snake shook its head, a deafening shout behind Harry made both of them jump. \u201cDUDLEY! MR. DURSLEY! COME AND LOOK AT THIS SNAKE! YOU WON\u2019T BELIEVE WHAT IT\u2019S DOING!\u201d"}
{"text": "Dudley came waddling toward them as fast as he could."}
{"text": "\u201cOut of the way, you,\u201d he said, punching Harry in the ribs. Caught by surprise, Harry fell hard on the concrete floor. What came next happened so fast no one saw how it happened \u2014 one second, Piers and Dudley were leaning right up close to the glass, the next, they had leapt back with howls of horror."}
{"text": "Harry sat up and gasped; the glass front of the boa constrictor\u2019s tank had vanished. The great snake was uncoiling itself rapidly, slithering out onto the floor. People throughout the reptile house screamed and started running for the exits."}
{"text": "As the snake slid swiftly past him, Harry could have sworn a low, hissing voice said, \u201cBrazil, here I come.\u2026 Thanksss, amigo.\u201d"}
{"text": "The keeper of the reptile house was in shock."}
{"text": "\u201cBut the glass,\u201d he kept saying, \u201cwhere did the glass go?\u201d"}
{"text": "The zoo director himself made Aunt Petunia a cup of strong, sweet tea while he apologized over and over again. Piers and Dudley could only gibber. As far as Harry had seen, the snake hadn\u2019t done anything except snap playfully at their heels as it passed, but by the time they were all back in Uncle Vernon\u2019s car, Dudley was telling them how it had nearly bitten off his leg, while Piers was swearing it had tried to squeeze him to death. But worst of all, for Harry at least, was Piers calming down enough to say, \u201cHarry was talking to it, weren\u2019t you, Harry?\u201d"}
{"text": "Uncle Vernon waited until Piers was safely out of the house before starting on Harry. He was so angry he could hardly speak. He managed to say, \u201cGo \u2014 cupboard \u2014 stay \u2014 no meals,\u201d before he collapsed into a chair, and Aunt Petunia had to run and get him a large brandy."}
{"text": "Harry lay in his dark cupboard much later, wishing he had a watch. He didn\u2019t know what time it was and he couldn\u2019t be sure the Dursleys were asleep yet. Until they were, he couldn\u2019t risk sneaking to the kitchen for some food."}
{"text": "He\u2019d lived with the Dursleys almost ten years, ten miserable years, as long as he could remember, ever since he\u2019d been a baby and his parents had died in that car crash. He couldn\u2019t remember being in the car when his parents had died. Sometimes, when he strained his memory during long hours in his cupboard, he came up with a strange vision: a blinding flash of green light and a burning pain on his forehead. This, he supposed, was the crash, though he couldn\u2019t imagine where all the green light came from. He couldn\u2019t remember his parents at all. His aunt and uncle never spoke about them, and of course he was forbidden to ask questions. There were no photographs of them in the house."}
{"text": "When he had been younger, Harry had dreamed and dreamed of some unknown relation coming to take him away, but it had never happened; the Dursleys were his only family. Yet sometimes he thought (or maybe hoped) that strangers in the street seemed to know him. Very strange strangers they were, too. A tiny man in a violet top hat had bowed to him once while out shopping with Aunt Petunia and Dudley. After asking Harry furiously if he knew the man, Aunt Petunia had rushed them out of the shop without buying anything. A wild-looking old woman dressed all in green had waved merrily at him once on a bus. A bald man in a very long purple coat had actually shaken his hand in the street the other day and then walked away without a word. The weirdest thing about all these people was the way they seemed to vanish the second Harry tried to get a closer look."}
{"text": "At school, Harry had no one. Everybody knew that Dudley\u2019s gang hated that odd Harry Potter in his baggy old clothes and broken glasses, and nobody liked to disagree with Dudley\u2019s gang."}

{"text": "T he escape of the Brazilian boa constrictor earned Harry his longest-ever punishment. By the time he was allowed out of his cupboard again, the summer holidays had started and Dudley had already broken his new video camera, crashed his remote control airplane, and, first time out on his racing bike, knocked down old Mrs. Figg as she crossed Privet Drive on her crutches."}
{"text": "Harry was glad school was over, but there was no escaping Dudley\u2019s gang, who visited the house every single day. Piers, Dennis, Malcolm, and Gordon were all big and stupid, but as Dudley was the biggest and stupidest of the lot, he was the leader. The rest of them were all quite happy to join in Dudley\u2019s favorite sport: Harry Hunting."}
{"text": "This was why Harry spent as much time as possible out of the house, wandering around and thinking about the end of the holidays, where he could see a tiny ray of hope. When September came he would be going off to secondary school and, for the first time in his life, he wouldn\u2019t be with Dudley. Dudley had been accepted at Uncle Vernon\u2019s old private school, Smeltings. Piers Polkiss was going there too. Harry, on the other hand, was going to Stonewall High, the local public school. Dudley thought this was very funny."}
{"text": "\u201cThey stuff people\u2019s heads down the toilet the first day at Stonewall,\u201d he told Harry. \u201cWant to come upstairs and practice?\u201d"}
{"text": "\u201cNo, thanks,\u201d said Harry. \u201cThe poor toilet\u2019s never had anything as horrible as your head down it \u2014 it might be sick.\u201d Then he ran, before Dudley could work out what he\u2019d said."}
{"text": "One day in July, Aunt Petunia took Dudley to London to buy his Smeltings uniform, leaving Harry at Mrs. Figg\u2019s. Mrs. Figg wasn\u2019t as bad as usual. It turned out she\u2019d broken her leg tripping over one of her cats, and she didn\u2019t seem quite as fond of them as before. She let Harry watch television and gave him a bit of chocolate cake that tasted as though she\u2019d had it for several years."}
{"text": "That evening, Dudley paraded around the living room for the family in his brand-new uniform. Smeltings\u2019 boys wore maroon tailcoats, orange knickerbockers, and flat straw hats called boaters. They also carried knobbly sticks, used for hitting each other while the teachers weren\u2019t looking. This was supposed to be good training for later life."}
{"text": "As he looked at Dudley in his new knickerbockers, Uncle Vernon said gruffly that it was the proudest moment of his life. Aunt Petunia burst into tears and said she couldn\u2019t believe it was her Ickle Dudleykins, he looked so handsome and grown-up. Harry didn\u2019t trust himself to speak. He thought two of his ribs might already have cracked from trying not to laugh."}
{"text": "* * *"}
{"text": "There was a horrible smell in the kitchen the next morning when Harry went in for breakfast. It seemed to be coming from a large metal tub in the sink. He went to have a look. The tub was full of what looked like dirty rags swimming in gray water."}
{"text": "\u201cWhat\u2019s this?\u201d he asked Aunt Petunia. Her lips tightened as they always did if he dared to ask a question."}
{"text": "\u201cYour new school uniform,\u201d she said."}
{"text": "Harry looked in the bowl again."}
{"text": "\u201cOh,\u201d he said, \u201cI didn\u2019t realize it had to be so wet.\u201d"}
{"text": "\u201cDon\u2019t be stupid,\u201d snapped Aunt Petunia. \u201cI\u2019m dyeing some of Dudley\u2019s old things gray for you. It\u2019ll look just like everyone else\u2019s when I\u2019ve finished.\u201d"}
{"text": "Harry seriously doubted this, but thought it best not to argue. He sat down at the table and tried not to think about how he was going to look on his first day at Stonewall High \u2014 like he was wearing bits of old elephant skin, probably."}
{"text": "Dudley and Uncle Vernon came in, both with wrinkled noses because of the smell from Harry\u2019s new uniform. Uncle Vernon opened his newspaper as usual and Dudley banged his Smelting stick, which he carried everywhere, on the table."}
{"text": "They heard the click of the mail slot and flop of letters on the doormat."}
{"text": "\u201cGet the mail, Dudley,\u201d said Uncle Vernon from behind his paper."}
{"text": "\u201cMake Harry get it.\u201d"}
{"text": "\u201cGet the mail, Harry.\u201d"}
{"text": "\u201cMake Dudley get it.\u201d"}
{"text": "\u201cPoke him with your Smelting stick, Dudley.\u201d"}
{"text": "Harry dodged the Smelting stick and went to get the mail. Three things lay on the doormat: a postcard from Uncle Vernon\u2019s sister Marge, who was vacationing on the Isle of Wight, a brown envelope that looked like a bill, and \u2014 a letter for Harry."}
{"text": "Harry picked it up and stared at it, his heart twanging like a giant elastic band. No one, ever, in his whole life, had written to him. Who would? He had no friends, no other relatives \u2014 he didn\u2019t belong to the library, so he\u2019d never even got rude notes asking for books back. Yet here it was, a letter, addressed so plainly there could be no mistake:"}

{"text": "The envelope was thick and heavy, made of yellowish parchment, and the address was written in emerald-green ink. There was no stamp."}
{"text": "Turning the envelope over, his hand trembling, Harry saw a purple wax seal bearing a coat of arms; a lion, an eagle, a badger, and a snake surrounding a large letter H."}
{"text": "\u201cHurry up, boy!\u201d shouted Uncle Vernon from the kitchen. \u201cWhat are you doing, checking for letter bombs?\u201d He chuckled at his own joke."}
{"text": "Harry went back to the kitchen, still staring at his letter. He handed Uncle Vernon the bill and the postcard, sat down, and slowly began to open the yellow envelope."}
{"text": "Uncle Vernon ripped open the bill, snorted in disgust, and flipped over the postcard."}
{"text": "\u201cMarge\u2019s ill,\u201d he informed Aunt Petunia. \u201cAte a funny whelk.\u2026\u201d"}

{"text": "Harry was on the point of unfolding his letter, which was written on the same heavy parchment as the envelope, when it was jerked sharply out of his hand by Uncle Vernon."}
{"text": "\u201cThat\u2019s mine!\u201d said Harry, trying to snatch it back."}
{"text": "\u201cWho\u2019d be writing to you?\u201d sneered Uncle Vernon, shaking the letter open with one hand and glancing at it. His face went from red to green faster than a set of traffic lights. And it didn\u2019t stop there. Within seconds it was the grayish white of old porridge."}
{"text": "\u201cP-P-Petunia!\u201d he gasped."}
{"text": "Dudley tried to grab the letter to read it, but Uncle Vernon held it high out of his reach. Aunt Petunia took it curiously and read the first line. For a moment it looked as though she might faint. She clutched her throat and made a choking noise."}
{"text": "\u201cVernon! Oh my goodness \u2014 Vernon!\u201d"}
{"text": "They stared at each other, seeming to have forgotten that Harry and Dudley were still in the room. Dudley wasn\u2019t used to being ignored. He gave his father a sharp tap on the head with his Smelting stick."}
{"text": "\u201cI want to read that letter,\u201d he said loudly."}
{"text": "\u201cI want to read it,\u201d said Harry furiously, \u201cas it\u2019s mine.\u201d"}
{"text": "\u201cGet out, both of you,\u201d croaked Uncle Vernon, stuffing the letter back inside its envelope."}
{"text": "Harry didn\u2019t move."}
{"text": "\u201cI WANT MY LETTER!\u201d he shouted."}
{"text": "\u201cLet me see it!\u201d demanded Dudley."}
{"text": "\u201cOUT!\u201d roared Uncle Vernon, and he took both Harry and Dudley by the scruffs of their necks and threw them into the hall, slamming the kitchen door behind them. Harry and Dudley promptly had a furious but silent fight over who would listen at the keyhole; Dudley won, so Harry, his glasses dangling from one ear, lay flat on his stomach to listen at the crack between door and floor."}
{"text": "\u201cVernon,\u201d Aunt Petunia was saying in a quivering voice, \u201clook at the address \u2014 how could they possibly know where he sleeps? You don\u2019t think they\u2019re watching the house?\u201d"}
{"text": "\u201cWatching \u2014 spying \u2014 might be following us,\u201d muttered Uncle Vernon wildly."}
{"text": "\u201cBut what should we do, Vernon? Should we write back? Tell them we don\u2019t want \u2014\u201d"}
{"text": "Harry could see Uncle Vernon\u2019s shiny black shoes pacing up and down the kitchen."}
{"text": "\u201cNo,\u201d he said finally. \u201cNo, we\u2019ll ignore it. If they don\u2019t get an answer\u2026Yes, that\u2019s best\u2026we won\u2019t do anything\u2026\u201d"}

{"text": "That evening when he got back from work, Uncle Vernon did something he\u2019d never done before; he visited Harry in his cupboard."}
{"text": "\u201cWhere\u2019s my letter?\u201d said Harry, the moment Uncle Vernon had squeezed through the door. \u201cWho\u2019s writing to me?\u201d"}
{"text": "\u201cNo one. It was addressed to you by mistake,\u201d said Uncle Vernon shortly. \u201cI have burned it.\u201d"}
{"text": "\u201cIt was not a mistake,\u201d said Harry angrily, \u201cit had my cupboard on it.\u201d"}
{"text": "\u201cSILENCE!\u201d yelled Uncle Vernon, and a couple of spiders fell from the ceiling. He took a few deep breaths and then forced his face into a smile, which looked quite painful."}
{"text": "\u201cEr \u2014 yes, Harry \u2014 about this cupboard. Your aunt and I have been thinking\u2026you\u2019re really getting a bit big for it\u2026we think it might be nice if you moved into Dudley\u2019s second bedroom."}
{"text": "\u201cWhy?\u201d said Harry."}
{"text": "\u201cDon\u2019t ask questions!\u201d snapped his uncle. \u201cTake this stuff upstairs, now.\u201d"}
{"text": "The Dursleys\u2019 house had four bedrooms: one for Uncle Vernon and Aunt Petunia, one for visitors (usually Uncle Vernon\u2019s sister, Marge), one where Dudley slept, and one where Dudley kept all the toys and things that wouldn\u2019t fit into his first bedroom. It only took Harry one trip upstairs to move everything he owned from the cupboard to this room. He sat down on the bed and stared around him. Nearly everything in here was broken. The month-old video camera was lying on top of a small, working tank Dudley had once driven over the next door neighbor\u2019s dog; in the corner was Dudley\u2019s first-ever television set, which he\u2019d put his foot through when his favorite program had been canceled; there was a large birdcage, which had once held a parrot that Dudley had swapped at school for a real air rifle, which was up on a shelf with the end all bent because Dudley had sat on it. Other shelves were full of books. They were the only things in the room that looked as though they\u2019d never been touched."}
{"text": "From downstairs came the sound of Dudley bawling at his mother, I don\u2019t want him in there\u2026I need that room\u2026make him get out...\u201d"}
{"text": "Harry sighed and stretched out on the bed. Yesterday he\u2019d have given anything to be up here. Today he\u2019d rather be back in his cupboard with that letter than up here without it."}
{"text": "Next morning at breakfast, everyone was rather quiet. Dudley was in shock. He\u2019d screamed, whacked his father with his Smelting stick, been sick on purpose, kicked his mother, and thrown his tortoise through the greenhouse roof, and he still didn\u2019t have his room back. Harry was thinking about this time yesterday and bitterly wishing he\u2019d opened the letter in the hall. Uncle Vernon and Aunt Petunia kept looking at each other darkly."}
{"text": "When the mail arrived, Uncle Vernon, who seemed to be trying to be nice to Harry, made Dudley go and get it. They heard him banging things with his Smelting stick all the way down the hall. Then he shouted, \u201cThere\u2019s another one! \u2018Mr. H. Potter, The Smallest Bedroom, 4 Privet Drive \u2014\u2019\u201d"}
{"text": "With a strangled cry, Uncle Vernon leapt from his seat and ran down the hall, Harry right behind him. Uncle Vernon had to wrestle Dudley to the ground to get the letter from him, which was made difficult by the fact that Harry had grabbed Uncle Vernon around the neck from behind. After a minute of confused fighting, in which everyone got hit a lot by the Smelting stick, Uncle Vernon straightened up, gasping for breath, with Harry\u2019s letter clutched in his hand."}
{"text": "\u201cGo to your cupboard \u2014 I mean, your bedroom,\u201d he wheezed at Harry. \u201cDudley \u2014 go \u2014 just go.\u201d"}
{"text": "Harry walked round and round his new room. Someone knew he had moved out of his cupboard and they seemed to know he hadn\u2019t received his first letter. Surely that meant they\u2019d try again? And this time he\u2019d make sure they didn\u2019t fail. He had a plan."}
{"text": "The repaired alarm clock rang at six o\u2019clock the next morning. Harry turned it off quickly and dressed silently. He mustn\u2019t wake the Dursleys. He stole downstairs without turning on any of the lights."}
{"text": "He was going to wait for the postman on the corner of Privet Drive and get the letters for number four first. His heart hammered as he crept across the dark hall toward the front door \u2014"}
{"text": "\u201cAAAAARRRGH!\u201d"}
{"text": "Harry leapt into the air; he\u2019d trodden on something big and squashy on the doormat \u2014 something alive!"}
{"text": "Lights clicked on upstairs and to his horror Harry realized that the big, squashy something had been his uncle\u2019s face. Uncle Vernon had been lying at the foot of the front door in a sleeping bag, clearly making sure that Harry didn\u2019t do exactly what he\u2019d been trying to do. He shouted at Harry for about half an hour and then told him to go and make a cup of tea. Harry shuffled miserably off into the kitchen and by the time he got back, the mail had arrived, right into Uncle Vernon\u2019s lap. Harry could see three letters addressed in green ink."}
{"text": "\u201cI want \u2014\u201d he began, but Uncle Vernon was tearing the letters into pieces before his eyes."}
{"text": "Uncle Vernon didn\u2019t go to work that day. He stayed at home and nailed up the mail slot."}
{"text": "\u201cSee,\u201d he explained to Aunt Petunia through a mouthful of nails, \u201cif they can\u2019t deliver them they\u2019ll just give up.\u201d"}
{"text": "\u201cI\u2019m not sure that\u2019ll work, Vernon.\u201d"}
{"text": "\u201cOh, these people\u2019s minds work in strange ways, Petunia, they\u2019re not like you and me,\u201d said Uncle Vernon, trying to knock in a nail with the piece of fruitcake Aunt Petunia had just brought him."}
{"text": "On Friday, no less than twelve letters arrived for Harry. As they couldn\u2019t go through the mail slot they had been pushed under the door, slotted through the sides, and a few even forced through the small window in the downstairs bathroom."}
{"text": "Uncle Vernon stayed at home again. After burning all the letters, he got out a hammer and nails and boarded up the cracks around the front and back doors so no one could go out. He hummed \u201cTiptoe Through the Tulips\u201d as he worked, and jumped at small noises."}
{"text": "On Saturday, things began to get out of hand. Twenty-four letters to Harry found their way into the house, rolled up and hidden inside each of the two dozen eggs that their very confused milkman had handed Aunt Petunia through the living room window. While Uncle Vernon made furious telephone calls to the post office and the dairy trying to find someone to complain to, Aunt Petunia shredded the letters in her food processor."}
{"text": "\u201cWho on earth wants to talk to you this badly?\u201d Dudley asked Harry in amazement."}
{"text": "* * *"}
{"text": "On Sunday morning, Uncle Vernon sat down at the breakfast table looking tired and rather ill, but happy."}
{"text": "\u201cNo post on Sundays,\u201d he reminded them cheerfully as he spread marmalade on his newspapers, \u201cno damn letters today \u2014\u201d"}
{"text": "Something came whizzing down the kitchen chimney as he spoke and caught him sharply on the back of the head. Next moment, thirty or forty letters came pelting out of the fireplace like bullets. The Dursleys ducked, but Harry leapt into the air trying to catch one \u2014"}
{"text": "\u201cOut! OUT!\u201d"}
{"text": "Uncle Vernon seized Harry around the waist and threw him into the hall. When Aunt Petunia and Dudley had run out with their arms over their faces, Uncle Vernon slammed the door shut. They could hear the letters still streaming into the room, bouncing off the walls and floor."}
{"text": "\u201cThat does it,\u201d said Uncle Vernon, trying to speak calmly but pulling great tufts out of his mustache at the same time. \u201cI want you all back here in five minutes ready to leave. We\u2019re going away. Just pack some clothes. No arguments!\u201d"}
{"text": "He looked so dangerous with half his mustache missing that no one dared argue. Ten minutes later they had wrenched their way through the boarded-up doors and were in the car, speeding toward the highway. Dudley was sniffling in the back seat; his father had hit him round the head for holding them up while he tried to pack his television, VCR, and computer in his sports bag."}
{"text": "They drove. And they drove. Even Aunt Petunia didn\u2019t dare ask where they were going. Every now and then Uncle Vernon would take a sharp turn and drive in the opposite direction for a while."}
{"text": "\u201cShake \u2019em off\u2026shake \u2019em off,\u201d he would mutter whenever he did this."}
{"text": "They didn\u2019t stop to eat or drink all day. By nightfall Dudley was howling. He\u2019d never had such a bad day in his life. He was hungry, he\u2019d missed five television programs he\u2019d wanted to see, and he\u2019d never gone so long without blowing up an alien on his computer."}
{"text": "Uncle Vernon stopped at last outside a gloomy-looking hotel on the outskirts of a big city. Dudley and Harry shared a room with twin beds and damp, musty sheets. Dudley snored but Harry stayed awake, sitting on the windowsill, staring down at the lights of passing cars and wondering.\u2026"}
{"text": "They ate stale cornflakes and cold tinned tomatoes on toast for breakfast the next day. They had just finished when the owner of the hotel came over to their table."}
{"text": "\u201c\u2019Scuse me, but is one of you Mr. H. Potter? Only I got about an \u2019undred of these at the front desk.\u201d"}

{"text": "Harry made a grab for the letter but Uncle Vernon knocked his hand out of the way. The woman stared."}
{"text": "\u201cI\u2019ll take them,\u201d said Uncle Vernon, standing up quickly and following her from the dining room."}
{"text": "* * *"}
{"text": "\u201cWouldn\u2019t it be better just to go home, dear?\u201d Aunt Petunia suggested timidly, hours later, but Uncle Vernon didn\u2019t seem to hear her. Exactly what he was looking for, none of them knew. He drove them into the middle of a forest, got out, looked around, shook his head, got back in the car, and off they went again. The same thing happened in the middle of a plowed field, halfway across a suspension bridge, and at the top of a multilevel parking garage."}
{"text": "\u201cDaddy\u2019s gone mad, hasn\u2019t he?\u201d Dudley asked Aunt Petunia dully late that afternoon. Uncle Vernon had parked at the coast, locked them all inside the car, and disappeared."}
{"text": "It started to rain. Great drops beat on the roof of the car. Dudley sniveled."}
{"text": "\u201cIt\u2019s Monday,\u201d he told his mother. \u201cThe Great Humberto\u2019s on tonight. I want to stay somewhere with a television.\u201d"}
{"text": "Monday. This reminded Harry of something. If it was Monday \u2014 and you could usually count on Dudley to know the days the week, because of television \u2014 then tomorrow, Tuesday, was Harry\u2019s eleventh birthday. Of course, his birthdays were never exactly fun \u2014 last year, the Dursleys had given him a coat hanger and a pair of Uncle Vernon\u2019s old socks. Still, you weren\u2019t eleven every day."}
{"text": "Uncle Vernon was back and he was smiling. He was also carrying a long, thin package and didn\u2019t answer Aunt Petunia when she asked what he\u2019d bought."}
{"text": "\u201cFound the perfect place!\u201d he said. \u201cCome on! Everyone out!\u201d"}
{"text": "It was very cold outside the car. Uncle Vernon was pointing at what looked like a large rock way out at sea. Perched on top of the rock was the most miserable little shack you could imagine. One thing was certain, there was no television in there."}
{"text": "\u201cStorm forecast for tonight!\u201d said Uncle Vernon gleefully, clapping his hands together. \u201cAnd this gentleman\u2019s kindly agreed to lend us his boat!\u201d"}
{"text": "A toothless old man came ambling up to them, pointing, with a rather wicked grin, at an old rowboat bobbing in the iron-gray water below them."}
{"text": "\u201cI\u2019ve already got us some rations,\u201d said Uncle Vernon, \u201cso all aboard!\u201d"}
{"text": "It was freezing in the boat. Icy sea spray and rain crept down their necks and a chilly wind whipped their faces. After what seemed like hours they reached the rock, where Uncle Vernon, slipping and sliding, led the way to the broken-down house."}
{"text": "The inside was horrible; it smelled strongly of seaweed, the wind whistled through the gaps in the wooden walls, and the fireplace was damp and empty. There were only two rooms."}
{"text": "Uncle Vernon\u2019s rations turned out to be a bag of chips each and four bananas. He tried to start a fire but the empty chip bags just smoked and shriveled up."}
{"text": "\u201cCould do with some of those letters now, eh?\u201d he said cheerfully."}
{"text": "He was in a very good mood. Obviously he thought nobody stood a chance of reaching them here in a storm to deliver mail. Harry privately agreed, though the thought didn\u2019t cheer him up at all."}
{"text": "As night fell, the promised storm blew up around them. Spray from the high waves splattered the walls of the hut and a fierce wind rattled the filthy windows. Aunt Petunia found a few moldy blankets in the second room and made up a bed for Dudley on the moth-eaten sofa. She and Uncle Vernon went off to the lumpy bed next door, and Harry was left to find the softest bit of floor he could and to curl up under the thinnest, most ragged blanket."}
{"text": "The storm raged more and more ferociously as the night went on. Harry couldn\u2019t sleep. He shivered and turned over, trying to get comfortable, his stomach rumbling with hunger. Dudley\u2019s snores were drowned by the low rolls of thunder that started near midnight. The lighted dial of Dudley\u2019s watch, which was dangling over the edge of the sofa on his fat wrist, told Harry he\u2019d be eleven in ten minutes\u2019 time. He lay and watched his birthday tick nearer, wondering if the Dursleys would remember at all, wondering where the letter writer was now."}
{"text": "Five minutes to go. Harry heard something creak outside. He hoped the roof wasn\u2019t going to fall in, although he might be warmer if it did. Four minutes to go. Maybe the house in Privet Drive would be so full of letters when they got back that he\u2019d be able to steal one somehow."}
{"text": "Three minutes to go. Was that the sea, slapping hard on the rock like that? And (two minutes to go) what was that funny crunching noise? Was the rock crumbling into the sea?"}
{"text": "One minute to go and he\u2019d be eleven. Thirty seconds...twenty\u2026ten\u2026nine \u2014 maybe he\u2019d wake Dudley up, just to annoy him \u2014 three\u2026two\u2026one\u2026"}

{"text": "The giant squeezed his way into the hut, stooping so that his head just brushed the ceiling. He bent down, picked up the door, and fitted it easily back into its frame. The noise of the storm outside dropped a little. He turned to look at them all."}

{"text": "\u201cBudge up, yeh great lump,\u201d said the stranger."}
{"text": "Dudley squeaked and ran to hide behind his mother, who was crouching, terrified, behind Uncle Vernon."}
{"text": "\u201cAn\u2019 here\u2019s Harry!\u201d said the giant."}
{"text": "Harry looked up into the fierce, wild, shadowy face and saw that the beetle eyes were crinkled in a smile."}
{"text": "\u201cLas\u2019 time I saw you, you was only a baby,\u201d said the giant. \u201cYeh look a lot like yer dad, but yeh\u2019ve got yer mom\u2019s eyes.\u201d"}

{"text": "His eyes fell on the empty grate with the shriveled chip bags in it and he snorted. He bent down over the fireplace; they couldn\u2019t see what he was doing but when he drew back a second later, there was a roaring fire there. It filled the whole damp hut with flickering light and Harry felt the warmth wash over him as though he\u2019d sunk into a hot bath."}
{"text": "The giant sat back down on the sofa, which sagged under his weight, and began taking all sorts of things out of the pockets of his coat: a copper kettle, a squashy package of sausages, a poker, a teapot, several chipped mugs, and a bottle of some amber liquid that he took a swig from before starting to make tea. Soon the hut was full of the sound and smell of sizzling sausage. Nobody said a thing while the giant was working, but as he slid the first six fat, juicy, slightly burnt sausages from the poker, Dudley fidgeted a little. Uncle Vernon said sharply, \u201cDon\u2019t touch anything he gives you, Dudley.\u201d"}

{"text": "Hagrid looked as if he was about to explode."}
{"text": "\u201cDURSLEY!\u201d he boomed."}

{"text": "\u201cGallopin\u2019 Gorgons, that reminds me,\u201d said Hagrid, clapping a hand to his forehead with enough force to knock over a cart horse, and from yet another pocket inside his overcoat he pulled an owl \u2014 a real, live, rather ruffled-looking owl \u2014 a long quill, and a roll of parchment. With his tongue between his teeth he scribbled a note that Harry could read upside down:"}
{"text": "Dear Professor Dumbledore,"}
{"text": "Given Harry his letter."}

{"text": "Weather\u2019s horrible. Hope you\u2019re well."}

{"text": "\u201cIt was a dream, he told himself firmly. \u201cI dreamed a giant called Hagrid came to tell me I was going to a school for wizards. When I open my eyes I\u2019ll be at home in my cupboard.\u201d"}
{"text": "There was suddenly a loud tapping noise."}

{"text": "He sat up and Hagrid\u2019s heavy coat fell off him. The hut was full of sunlight, the storm was over, Hagrid himself was asleep on the collapsed sofa, and there was an owl rapping its claw on the window, a newspaper held in its beak."}
{"text": "Harry scrambled to his feet, so happy he felt as though a large balloon was swelling inside him. He went straight to the window and jerked it open.

{"text": "\u201cHe wants payin\u2019 fer deliverin\u2019 the paper. Look in the pockets.\u201d"}
{"text": "Hagrid\u2019s coat seemed to be made of nothing but pockets \u2014 bunches of keys, slug pellets, balls of string, peppermint humbugs, teabags...finally, Harry pulled out a handful of strange-looking coins."}
{"text": "\u201cGive him five Knuts,\u201d said Hagrid sleepily."}
{"text": "\u201cKnuts?\u201d"}
{"text": "\u201cThe little bronze ones.\u201d"}
{"text": "Harry counted out five little bronze coins, and the owl held out his leg so Harry could put the money into a small leather pouch tied to it. Then he flew off through the open window."}
{"text": "Hagrid yawned loudly, sat up, and stretched."}
{"text": "\u201cBest be off, Harry, lots ter do today, gotta get up ter London an\u2019 buy all yer stuff fer school.\u201d"}
{"text": "Harry was turning over the wizard coins and looking at them. He had just thought of something that made him feel as though the happy balloon inside him had got a puncture."}

{"text": "\u201cMm?\u201d said Hagrid, who was pulling on his huge boots."}

{"text": "\u201cGot everythin\u2019? Come on, then.\u201d"}
{"text": "Harry followed Hagrid out onto the rock. The sky was quite clear now and the sea gleamed in the sunlight. The boat Uncle Vernon had hired was still there, with a lot of water in the bottom after the storm."}
{"text": "\u201cHow did you get here?\u201d Harry asked, looking around for another boat."}
{"text": "\u201cFlew,\u201d said Hagrid."}
{"text": "\u201cFlew?\u201d"}
{"text": "\u201cYeah \u2014 but we\u2019ll go back in this. Not s\u2019pposed ter use magic now I\u2019ve got yeh.\u201d"}
{"text": "They settled down in the boat, Harry still staring at Hagrid, trying to imagine him flying."}
{"text": "\u201cSeems a shame ter row, though,\u201d said Hagrid, giving Harry another of his sideways looks. \u201cIf I was ter \u2014 er \u2014 speed things up a bit, would yeh mind not mentionin\u2019 it at Hogwarts?\u201d"}
{"text": "\u201cOf course not,\u201d said Harry, eager to see more magic. Hagrid pulled out the pink umbrella again, tapped it twice on the side of the boat, and they sped off toward land."}
{"text": "\u201cWhy would you be mad to try and rob Gringotts?\u201d Harry asked."}
{"text": "\u201cSpells \u2014 enchantments,\u201d said Hagrid, unfolding his newspaper as he spoke. \u201cThey say there\u2019s dragons guardin\u2019 the high security vaults. And then yeh gotta find yer way \u2014 Gringotts is hundreds of miles under London, see. Deep under the Underground. Yeh\u2019d die of hunger tryin\u2019 ter get out, even if yeh did manage ter get yer hands on summat.\u201d"}
{"text": "Harry sat and thought about this while Hagrid read his newspaper, the Daily Prophet. Harry had learned from Uncle Vernon that people liked to be left alone while they did this, but it was very difficult, he\u2019d never had so many questions in his life."}
{"text": "\u201cMinistry o\u2019 Magic messin\u2019 things up as usual,\u201d Hagrid muttered, turning the page."}
{"text": "\u201cThere\u2019s a Ministry of Magic?\u201d Harry asked, before he could stop himself."}
{"text": "\u201c\u2019Course,\u201d said Hagrid. \u201cThey wanted Dumbledore fer Minister, o\u2019 course, but he\u2019d never leave Hogwarts, so old Cornelius Fudge got the job. Bungler if ever there was one. So he pelts Dumbledore with owls every morning, askin\u2019 fer advice.\u201d"}
{"text": "\u201cBut what does a Ministry of Magic do?\u201d"}
{"text": "\u201cWell, their main job is to keep it from the Muggles that there\u2019s still witches an\u2019 wizards up an\u2019 down the country.\u201d"}
{"text": "\u201cWhy?\u201d"}
{"text": "\u201cWhy? Blimey, Harry, everyone\u2019d be wantin\u2019 magic solutions to their problems. Nah, we\u2019re best left alone.\u201d"}
{"text": "At this moment the boat bumped gently into the harbor wall. Hagrid folded up his newspaper, and they clambered up the stone steps onto the street."}
{"text": "Passersby stared a lot at Hagrid as they walked through the little town to the station. Harry couldn\u2019t blame them.

Things these Muggles dream up, eh?\u201d"}

{"text": "People stared more than ever on the train. Hagrid took up two seats and sat knitting what looked like a canary-yellow circus tent."}
{"text": "\u201cStill got yer letter, Harry?\u201d he asked as he counted stitches."}
{"text": "Harry took the parchment envelope out of his pocket."}

{"text": "\u201cCan we buy all this in London?\u201d Harry wondered aloud."}
{"text": "\u201cIf yeh know where to go,\u201d said Hagrid."}
{"text": "Harry had never been to London before. Although Hagrid seemed to know where he was going, he was obviously not used to getting there in an ordinary way. He got stuck in the ticket barrier on the Underground, and complained loudly that the seats were too small and the trains too slow."}
{"text": "\u201cI don\u2019t know how the Muggles manage without magic,\u201d he said as they climbed a broken-down escalator that led up to a bustling road lined with shops."}
{"text": "Hagrid was so huge that he parted the crowd easily; all Harry had to do was keep close behind him. They passed book shops and music stores, hamburger restaurants and cinemas, but nowhere that looked as if it could sell you a magic wand. This was just an ordinary street full of ordinary people. Could there really be piles of wizard gold buried miles beneath them? Were there really shops that sold spell books and broomsticks? Might this not all be some huge joke that the Dursleys had cooked up? If Harry hadn\u2019t known that the Dursleys had no sense of humor, he might have thought so; yet somehow, even though everything Hagrid had told him so far was unbelievable, Harry couldn\u2019t help trusting him."}
{"text": "\u201cThis is it,\u201d said Hagrid, coming to a halt, \u201cthe Leaky Cauldron. It\u2019s a famous place.\u201d"}
{"text": "It was a tiny, grubby-looking pub. If Hagrid hadn\u2019t pointed it out, Harry wouldn\u2019t have noticed it was there. The people hurrying by didn\u2019t glance at it. Their eyes slid from the big book shop on one side to the record shop on the other as if they couldn\u2019t see the Leaky Cauldron at all. In fact, Harry had the most peculiar feeling that only he and Hagrid could see it. Before he could mention this, Hagrid had steered him inside."}
{"text": "For a famous place, it was very dark and shabby. A few old women were sitting in a corner, drinking tiny glasses of sherry. One of them was smoking a long pipe. A little man in a top hat was talking to the old bartender, who was quite bald and looked like a toothless walnut. The low buzz of chatter stopped when they walked in. Everyone seemed to know Hagrid; they waved and smiled at him, and the bartender reached for a glass, saying, \u201cThe usual, Hagrid?\u201d"}
{"text": "\u201cCan\u2019t, Tom, I\u2019m on Hogwarts business,\u201d said Hagrid, clapping his great hand on Harry\u2019s shoulder and making Harry\u2019s knees buckle."}
{"text": "\u201cGood Lord,\u201d said the bartender, peering at Harry, \u201cis this \u2014 can this be \u2014?\u201d"}
{"text": "The Leaky Cauldron had suddenly gone completely still and silent."}
{"text": "\u201cBless my soul,\u201d whispered the old bartender, \u201cHarry Potter\u2026what an honor.\u201d"}
{"text": "He hurried out from behind the bar, rushed toward Harry and seized his hand, tears in his eyes."}
{"text": "\u201cWelcome back, Mr. Potter, welcome back.\u201d"}
{"text": "Harry didn\u2019t know what to say. Everyone was looking at him. The old woman with the pipe was puffing on it without realizing it had gone out. Hagrid was beaming."}
{"text": "Then there was a great scraping of chairs and the next moment, Harry found himself shaking hands with everyone in the Leaky Cauldron."}
{"text": "\u201cDoris Crockford, Mr. Potter, can\u2019t believe I\u2019m meeting you at last.\u201d"}
{"text": "\u201cSo proud, Mr. Potter, I\u2019m just so proud.\u201d"}
{"text": "\u201cAlways wanted to shake your hand \u2014 I\u2019m all of a flutter.\u201d"}
{"text": "\u201cDelighted, Mr. Potter, just can\u2019t tell you, Diggle\u2019s the name, Dedalus Diggle.\u201d"}
{"text": "\u201cI\u2019ve seen you before!\u201d said Harry, as Dedalus Diggle\u2019s top hat fell off in his excitement. \u201cYou bowed to me once in a shop.\u201d"}
{"text": "\u201cHe remembers!\u201d cried Dedalus Diggle, looking around at everyone. \u201cDid you hear that? He remembers me!\u201d Harry shook hands again and again \u2014 Doris Crockford kept coming back for more."}
{"text": "A pale young man made his way forward, very nervously. One of his eyes was twitching."}
{"text": "\u201cProfessor Quirrell!\u201d said Hagrid. \u201cHarry, Professor Quirrell will be one of your teachers at Hogwarts.\u201d"}
{"text": "\u201cP-P-Potter,\u201d stammered Professor Quirrell, grasping Harry\u2019s hand, \u201cc-can\u2019t t-tell you how p-pleased I am to meet you.\u201d"}
{"text": "\u201cWhat sort of magic do you teach, Professor Quirrell?\u201d"}
{"text": "\u201cD-Defense Against the D-D-Dark Arts,\u201d muttered Professor Quirrell, as though he\u2019d rather not think about it. \u201cN-not that you n-need it, eh, P-P-Potter?\u201d He laughed nervously. \u201cYou\u2019ll be g-getting all your equipment, I suppose? I\u2019ve g-got to p-pick up a new b-book on vampires, m-myself.\u201d He looked terrified at the very thought."}
{"text": "But the others wouldn\u2019t let Professor Quirrell keep Harry to himself. It took almost ten minutes to get away from them all. At last, Hagrid managed to make himself heard over the babble."}
{"text": "\u201cMust get on \u2014 lots ter buy. Come on, Harry.\u201d"}
{"text": "Doris Crockford shook Harry\u2019s hand one last time, and Hagrid led them through the bar and out into a small, walled courtyard, where there was nothing but a trash can and a few weeds."}
{"text": "Hagrid grinned at Harry."}
{"text": "\u201cTold yeh, didn\u2019t I? Told yeh you was famous. Even Professor Quirrell was tremblin\u2019 ter meet yeh \u2014 mind you, he\u2019s usually tremblin\u2019.\u201d"}
{"text": "\u201cIs he always that nervous?\u201d"}
{"text": "\u201cOh, yeah. Poor bloke. Brilliant mind. He was fine while he was studyin\u2019 outta books but then he took a year off ter get some firsthand experience....They say he met vampires in the Black Forest, and there was a nasty bit o\u2019 trouble with a hag \u2014 never been the same since. Scared of the students, scared of his own subject \u2014 now, where\u2019s me umbrella?\u201d"}
{"text": "Vampires? Hags? Harry\u2019s head was swimming. Hagrid, meanwhile, was counting bricks in the wall above the trash can."}
{"text": "\u201cThree up\u2026two across\u2026\u201d he muttered. \u201cRight, stand back, Harry.\u201d"}
{"text": "He tapped the wall three times with the point of his umbrella."}
{"text": "The brick he had touched quivered \u2014 it wriggled \u2014 in the middle, a small hole appeared \u2014 it grew wider and wider \u2014 a second later they were facing an archway large enough even for Hagrid, an archway onto a cobbled street that twisted and turned out of sight."}
{"text": "\u201cWelcome,\u201d said Hagrid, \u201cto Diagon Alley.\u201d"}
{"text": "He grinned at Harry\u2019s amazement. They stepped through the archway. Harry looked quickly over his shoulder and saw the archway shrink instantly back into solid wall."}
{"text": "The sun shone brightly on a stack of cauldrons outside the nearest shop. Cauldrons \u2014 All Sizes \u2014 Copper, Brass, Pewter, Silver \u2014 Self-Stirring \u2014 Collapsible, said a sign hanging over them."}
{"text": "\u201cYeah, you\u2019ll be needin\u2019 one,\u201d said Hagrid, \u201cbut we gotta get yer money first.\u201d"}
{"text": "Harry wished he had about eight more eyes. He turned his head in every direction as they walked up the street, trying to look at everything at once: the shops, the things outside them, the people doing their shopping. A plump woman outside an Apothecary was shaking her head as they passed, saying, \u201cDragon liver, seventeen Sickles an ounce, they\u2019re mad.\u2026\u201d"}
{"text": "A low, soft hooting came from a dark shop with a sign saying Eeylops Owl Emporium \u2014 Tawny, Screech, Barn, Brown, and Snowy. Several boys of about Harry\u2019s age had their noses pressed against a window with broomsticks in it. \u201cLook,\u201d Harry heard one of them say, \u201cthe new Nimbus Two Thousand \u2014 fastest ever \u2014\u201d There were shops selling robes, shops selling telescopes and strange silver instruments Harry had never seen before, windows stacked with barrels of bat spleens and eels\u2019 eyes, tottering piles of spell books, quills, and rolls of parchment, potion bottles, globes of the moon.\u2026"}
{"text": "\u201cGringotts,\u201d said Hagrid."}
{"text": "They had reached a snowy white building that towered over the other little shops. Standing beside its burnished bronze doors, wearing a uniform of scarlet and gold, was \u2014"}
{"text": "\u201cYeah, that\u2019s a goblin,\u201d said Hagrid quietly as they walked up the white stone steps toward him. The goblin was about a head shorter than Harry. He had a swarthy, clever face, a pointed beard and, Harry noticed, very long fingers and feet. He bowed as they walked inside. Now they were facing a second pair of doors, silver this time, with words engraved upon them:"}
{"text": "Enter, stranger, but take heed"}
{"text": "Of what awaits the sin of greed,"}
{"text": "For those who take, but do not earn,"}
{"text": "Must pay most dearly in their turn."}
{"text": "So if you seek beneath our floors"}
{"text": "A treasure that was never yours,"}
{"text": "Thief, you have been warned, beware"}
{"text": "Of finding more than treasure there."}
{"text": "\u201cLike I said, Yeh\u2019d be mad ter try an\u2019 rob it,\u201d said Hagrid."}
{"text": "A pair of goblins bowed them through the silver doors and they were in a vast marble hall. About a hundred more goblins were sitting on high stools behind a long counter, scribbling in large ledgers, weighing coins in brass scales, examining precious stones through eyeglasses. There were too many doors to count leading off the hall, and yet more goblins were showing people in and out of these. Hagrid and Harry made for the counter."}
{"text": "\u201cMorning,\u201d said Hagrid to a free goblin. \u201cWe\u2019ve come ter take some money outta Mr. Harry Potter\u2019s safe.\u201d"}
{"text": "\u201cYou have his key, sir?\u201d"}
{"text": "\u201cGot it here somewhere,\u201d said Hagrid, and he started emptying his pockets onto the counter, scattering a handful of moldy dog biscuits over the goblin\u2019s book of numbers. The goblin wrinkled his nose. Harry watched the goblin on their right weighing a pile of rubies as big as glowing coals."}
{"text": "\u201cGot it,\u201d said Hagrid at last, holding up a tiny golden key."}
{"text": "The goblin looked at it closely."}
{"text": "\u201cThat seems to be in order.\u201d"}
{"text": "\u201cAn\u2019 I\u2019ve also got a letter here from Professor Dumbledore,\u201d said Hagrid importantly, throwing out his chest. \u201cIt\u2019s about the You-Know-What in vault seven hundred and thirteen.\u201d"}
{"text": "The goblin read the letter carefully."}
{"text": "\u201cVery well,\u201d he said, handing it back to Hagrid, \u201cI will have someone take you down to both vaults. Griphook!\u201d"}
{"text": "Griphook was yet another goblin. Once Hagrid had crammed all the dog biscuits back inside his pockets, he and Harry followed Griphook toward one of the doors leading off the hall."}
{"text": "\u201cWhat\u2019s the You-Know-What in vault seven hundred and thirteen?\u201d Harry asked."}
{"text": "\u201cCan\u2019t tell yeh that,\u201d said Hagrid mysteriously. \u201cVery secret. Hogwarts business. Dumbledore\u2019s trusted me. More\u2019n my job\u2019s worth ter tell yeh that.\u201d"}
{"text": "Griphook held the door open for them. Harry, who had expected more marble, was surprised. They were in a narrow stone passageway lit with flaming torches. It sloped steeply downward and there were little railway tracks on the floor. Griphook whistled and a small cart came hurtling up the tracks toward them. They climbed in \u2014 Hagrid with some difficulty \u2014 and were off."}
{"text": "At first they just hurtled through a maze of twisting passages. Harry tried to remember, left, right, right, left, middle fork, right, left, but it was impossible. The rattling cart seemed to know its own way, because Griphook wasn\u2019t steering."}
{"text": "Harry\u2019s eyes stung as the cold air rushed past them, but he kept them wide open. Once, he thought he saw a burst of fire at the end of a passage and twisted around to see if it was a dragon, but too late \u2014 they plunged even deeper, passing an underground lake where huge stalactites and stalagmites grew from the ceiling and floor."}
{"text": "\u201cI never know,\u201d Harry called to Hagrid over the noise of the cart, \u201cwhat\u2019s the difference between a stalagmite and a stalactite?\u201d"}
{"text": "\u201cStalagmite\u2019s got an \u2018m\u2019 in it,\u201d said Hagrid. \u201cAn\u2019 don\u2019 ask me questions just now, I think I\u2019m gonna be sick.\u201d"}
{"text": "He did look very green, and when the cart stopped at last beside a small door in the passage wall, Hagrid got out and had to lean against the wall to stop his knees from trembling."}
{"text": "Griphook unlocked the door. A lot of green smoke came billowing out, and as it cleared, Harry gasped. Inside were mounds of gold coins. Columns of silver. Heaps of little bronze Knuts."}
{"text": "\u201cAll yours,\u201d smiled Hagrid."}
{"text": "All Harry\u2019s \u2014 it was incredible. The Dursleys couldn\u2019t have known about this or they\u2019d have had it from him faster than blinking. How often had they complained how much Harry cost them to keep? And all the time there had been a small fortune belonging to him, buried deep under London."}
{"text": "Hagrid helped Harry pile some of it into a bag."}
{"text": "\u201cThe gold ones are Galleons,\u201d he explained. \u201cSeventeen silver Sickles to a Galleon and twenty-nine Knuts to a Sickle, it\u2019s easy enough. Right, that should be enough fer a couple o\u2019 terms, we\u2019ll keep the rest safe for yeh.\u201d He turned to Griphook. \u201cVault seven hundred and thirteen now, please, and can we go more slowly?\u201d"}
{"text": "\u201cOne speed only,\u201d said Griphook."}
{"text": "They were going even deeper now and gathering speed. The air became colder and colder as they hurtled round tight corners. They went rattling over an underground ravine, and Harry leaned over the side to try to see what was down at the dark bottom, but Hagrid groaned and pulled him back by the scruff of his neck."}
{"text": "Vault seven hundred and thirteen had no keyhole."}
{"text": "\u201cStand back,\u201d said Griphook importantly. He stroked the door gently with one of his long fingers and it simply melted away."}

{"text": "\u201cHow often do you check to see if anyone\u2019s inside?\u201d Harry asked."}
{"text": "\u201cAbout once every ten years,\u201d said Griphook with a rather nasty grin."}
{"text": "Something really extraordinary had to be inside this top security vault, Harry was sure, and he leaned forward eagerly, expecting to see fabulous jewels at the very least \u2014 but at first he thought it was empty. Then he noticed a grubby little package wrapped up in brown paper lying on the floor. Hagrid picked it up and tucked it deep inside his coat. Harry longed to know what it was, but knew better than to ask."}
{"text": "\u201cCome on, back in this infernal cart, and don\u2019t talk to me on the way back, it\u2019s best if I keep me mouth shut,\u201d said Hagrid."}
{"text": "One wild cart ride later they stood blinking in the sunlight outside Gringotts. Harry didn\u2019t know where to run first now that he had a bag full of money. He didn\u2019t have to know how many Galleons there were to a pound to know that he was holding more money than he\u2019d had in his whole life \u2014 more money than even Dudley had ever had."}
{"text": "\u201cMight as well get yer uniform,\u201d said Hagrid, nodding toward Madam Malkin\u2019s Robes for All Occasions. \u201cListen, Harry, would yeh mind if I slipped off fer a pick-me-up in the Leaky Cauldron? I hate them Gringotts carts.\u201d He did still look a bit sick, so Harry entered Madam Malkin\u2019s shop alone, feeling nervous."}
{"text": "Madam Malkin was a squat, smiling witch dressed all in mauve."}
{"text": "\u201cHogwarts, dear?\u201d she said, when Harry started to speak. \u201cGot the lot here \u2014 another young man being fitted up just now, in fact.\u201d"}

He had a bored, drawling voice. \u201cThen I\u2019m going to drag them off to took at racing brooms. I don\u2019t see why first years can\u2019t have their own. I think I\u2019ll bully father into getting me one and I\u2019ll smuggle it in somehow.\u201d"}
{"text": "Harry was strongly reminded of Dudley."}
{"text": "\u201cHave you got your own broom?\u201d the boy went on."}
{"text": "\u201cNo,\u201d said Harry."}
{"text": "\u201cPlay Quidditch at all?\u201d"}
{"text": "\u201cNo,\u201d Harry said again, wondering what on earth Quidditch could be."}
{"text": "\u201cI do \u2014 Father says it\u2019s a crime if I\u2019m not picked to play for my house, and I must say, I agree. Know what house you\u2019ll be in yet?\u201d"}
{"text": "\u201cNo,\u201d said Harry, feeling more stupid by the minute."}
{"text": "\u201cWell, no one really knows until they get there, do they, but I know I\u2019ll be in Slytherin, all our family have been \u2014 imagine being in Hufflepuff, I think I\u2019d leave, wouldn\u2019t you?\u201d"}
{"text": "\u201cMmm,\u201d said Harry, wishing he could say something a bit more interesting."}
{"text": "\u201cI say, look at that man!\u201d said the boy suddenly, nodding toward the front window. Hagrid was standing there, grinning at Harry and pointing at two large ice creams to show he couldn\u2019t come in."}
{"text": "\u201cThat\u2019s Hagrid,\u201d said Harry, pleased to know something the boy didn\u2019t. \u201cHe works at Hogwarts.\u201d"}
{"text": "\u201cOh,\u201d said the boy, \u201cI\u2019ve heard of him. He\u2019s a sort of servant, isn\u2019t he?\u201d"}
{"text": "\u201cHe\u2019s the gamekeeper,\u201d said Harry. He was liking the boy less and less every second."}
{"text": "\u201cYes, exactly. I heard he\u2019s a sort of savage \u2014 lives in a hut on the school grounds and every now and then he gets drunk, tries to do magic, and ends up setting fire to his bed.\u201d"}
{"text": "\u201cI think he\u2019s brilliant,\u201d said Harry coldly."}
{"text": "\u201cDo you?\u201d said the boy, with a slight sneer. \u201cWhy is he with you? Where are your parents?\u201d"}
{"text": "\u201cThey\u2019re dead,\u201d said Harry shortly. He didn\u2019t feel much like going into the matter with this boy."}
{"text": "\u201cOh, sorry,\u201d said the other, not sounding sorry at all. \u201cBut they were our kind, weren\u2019t they?\u201d"}
{"text": "\u201cThey were a witch and wizard, if that\u2019s what you mean.\u201d"}
{"text": "\u201cI really don\u2019t think they should let the other sort in, do you? They\u2019re just not the same, they\u2019ve never been brought up to know our ways. Some of them have never even heard of Hogwarts until they get the letter, imagine. I think they should keep it in the old wizarding families. What\u2019s your surname, anyway?\u201d"}
{"text": "But before Harry could answer, Madam Malkin said, \u201cThat\u2019s you done, my dear,\u201d and Harry, not sorry for an excuse to stop talking to the boy, hopped down from the footstool."}
{"text": "\u201cWell, I\u2019ll see you at Hogwarts, I suppose,\u201d said the drawling boy."}
{"text": "Harry was rather quiet as he ate the ice cream Hagrid had bought him (chocolate and raspberry with chopped nuts)."}
{"text": "\u201cWhat\u2019s up?\u201d said Hagrid."}
{"text": "\u201cNothing,\u201d Harry lied. They stopped to buy parchment and quills. Harry cheered up a bit when he found a bottle of ink that changed color as you wrote. When they had left the shop, he said, \u201cHagrid, what\u2019s Quidditch?\u201d"}
{"text": "\u201cBlimey, Harry, I keep forgettin\u2019 how little yeh know \u2014 not knowin\u2019 about Quidditch!\u201d"}
{"text": "\u201cDon\u2019t make me feel worse,\u201d said Harry. He told Hagrid about the pale boy in Madam Malkin\u2019s."}
{"text": "\u201c\u2014 and he said people from Muggle families shouldn\u2019t even be allowed in \u2014\u201d"}
{"text": "\u201cYer not from a Muggle family. If he\u2019d known who yeh were \u2014 he\u2019s grown up knowin\u2019 yer name if his parents are wizardin\u2019 folk. You saw what everyone in the Leaky Cauldron was like when they saw yeh.

Look what she had fer a sister!\u201d"}
{"text": "\u201cSo what is Quidditch?\u201d"}
{"text": "\u201cIt\u2019s our sport. Wizard sport. It\u2019s like \u2014 like soccer in the Muggle world \u2014 everyone follows Quidditch \u2014 played up in the air on broomsticks and there\u2019s four balls \u2014 sorta hard ter explain the rules.\u201d"}
{"text": "\u201cAnd what are Slytherin and Hufflepuff?\u201d"}
{"text": "\u201cSchool houses. There\u2019s four. Everyone says Hufflepuff are a lot o\u2019 duffers, but \u2014\u201d"}
{"text": "\u201cI bet I\u2019m in Hufflepuff,\u201d said Harry gloomily."}
{"text": "\u201cBetter Hufflepuff than Slytherin,\u201d said Hagrid darkly. \u201cThere\u2019s not a single witch or wizard who went bad who wasn\u2019t in Slytherin. You-Know-Who was one.\u201d"}
{"text": "\u201cVol-, sorry \u2014You-Know-Who was at Hogwarts?\u201d"}
{"text": "\u201cYears an\u2019 years ago,\u201d said Hagrid."}
{"text": "They bought Harry\u2019s school books in a shop called Flourish and Blotts where the shelves were stacked to the ceiling with books as large as paving stones bound in leather; books the size of postage stamps in covers of silk; books full of peculiar symbols and a few books with nothing in them at all. Even Dudley, who never read anything, would have been wild to get his hands on some of these. Hagrid almost had to drag Harry away from Curses and Countercurses (Bewitch Your Friends and Befuddle Your Enemies with the Latest Revenges: Hair Loss, Jelly-Legs, Tongue-Tying and Much, Much More) by Professor Vindictus Viridian."}
{"text": "\u201cI was trying to find out how to curse Dudley.\u201d"}
{"text": "\u201cI\u2019m not sayin\u2019 that\u2019s not a good idea, but yer not ter use magic in the Muggle world except in very special circumstances,\u201d said Hagrid. \u201cAn\u2019 anyway, yeh couldn\u2019 work any of them curses yet, yeh\u2019ll need a lot more study before yeh get ter that level.\u201d"}
{"text": "Hagrid wouldn\u2019t let Harry buy a solid gold cauldron, either (\u201cIt says pewter on yer list\u201d), but they got a nice set of scales for weighing potion ingredients and a collapsible brass telescope. Then they visited the Apothecary, which was fascinating enough to make up for its horrible smell, a mixture of bad eggs and rotted cabbages. Barrels of slimy stuff stood on the floor; jars of herbs, dried roots, and bright powders lined the walls; bundles of feathers, strings of fangs, and snarled claws hung from the ceiling. While Hagrid asked the man behind the counter for a supply of some basic potion ingredients for Harry, Harry himself examined silver unicorn horns at twenty-one Galleons each and minuscule, glittery-black beetle eyes (five Knuts a scoop)."}
{"text": "Outside the Apothecary, Hagrid checked Harry\u2019s list again."}
{"text": "\u201cJust yer wand left \u2014 A yeah, an\u2019 I still haven\u2019t got yeh a birthday present.\u201d"}

{"text": "Twenty minutes later, they left Eeylops Owl Emporium, which had been dark and full of rustling and flickering, jewel-bright eyes. Harry now carried a large cage that held a beautiful snowy owl, fast asleep with her head under her wing. He couldn\u2019t stop stammering his thanks, sounding just like Professor Quirrell."}
{"text": "\u201cDon\u2019 mention it,\u201d said Hagrid gruffly. \u201cDon\u2019 expect you\u2019ve had a lotta presents from them Dursleys. Just Ollivanders left now \u2014 only place fer wands, Ollivanders, and yeh gotta have the best wand.\u201d"}
{"text": "A magic wand\u2026this was what Harry had been really looking forward to."}
{"text": "The last shop was narrow and shabby. Peeling gold letters over the door read Ollivanders: Makers of Fine Wands since 382 B.C. A single wand lay on a faded purple cushion in the dusty window."}
{"text": "A tinkling bell rang somewhere in the depths of the shop as they stepped inside. It was a tiny place, empty except for a single, spindly chair that Hagrid sat on to wait. Harry felt strangely as though he had entered a very strict library; he swallowed a lot of new questions that had just occurred to him and looked instead at the thousands of narrow boxes piled neatly right up to the ceiling. For some reason, the back of his neck prickled. The very dust and silence in here seemed to tingle with some secret magic."}
{"text": "\u201cGood afternoon,\u201d said a soft voice. Harry jumped. Hagrid must have jumped, too, because there was a loud crunching noise and he got quickly off the spindly chair."}
{"text": "An old man was standing before them, his wide, pale eyes shining like moons through the gloom of the shop."}
{"text": "\u201cHello,\u201d said Harry awkwardly."}
{"text": "\u201cAh yes,\u201d said the man. \u201cYes, yes. I thought I\u2019d be seeing you soon. Harry Potter.\u201d It wasn\u2019t a question. \u201cYou have your mother\u2019s eyes. It seems only yesterday she was in here herself, buying her first wand. Ten and a quarter inches long, swishy, made of willow. Nice wand for charm work.\u201d"}
{"text": "Mr. Ollivander moved closer to Harry. Harry wished he would blink. Those silvery eyes were a bit creepy."}
{"text": "\u201cYour father, on the other hand, favored a mahogany wand. Eleven inches. Pliable. A little more power and excellent for transfiguration. Well, I say your father favored it \u2014 it\u2019s really the wand that chooses the wizard, of course.\u201d"}
{"text": "Mr. Ollivander had come so close that he and Harry were almost nose to nose. Harry could see himself reflected in those misty eyes."}
{"text": "\u201cAnd that\u2019s where\u2026\u201d"}
{"text": "Mr. Ollivander touched the lightning scar on Harry\u2019s forehead with a long, white finger."}
{"text": "\u201cI\u2019m sorry to say I sold the wand that did it,\u201d he said softly. \u201cThirteen-and-a-half inches. Yew. Powerful wand, very powerful, and in the wrong hands\u2026well, if I\u2019d known what that wand was going out into the world to do.\u2026\u201d"}
{"text": "He shook his head and then, to Harry\u2019s relief, spotted Hagrid."}
{"text": "\u201cRubeus! Rubeus Hagrid! How nice to see you again.\u2026Oak, sixteen inches, rather bendy, wasn\u2019t it?\u201d"}
{"text": "\u201cIt was, sir, yes,\u201d said Hagrid."}
{"text": "\u201cGood wand, that one. But I suppose they snapped it in half when you got expelled?\u201d said Mr. Ollivander, suddenly stern."}
{"text": "\u201cEr \u2014 yes, they did, yes,\u201d said Hagrid, shuffling his feet. \u201cI\u2019ve still got the pieces, though,\u201d he added brightly."}
{"text": "\u201cBut you don\u2019t use them?\u201d said Mr. Ollivander sharply."}
{"text": "\u201cOh, no, sir,\u201d said Hagrid quickly. Harry noticed he gripped his pink umbrella very tightly as he spoke."}
{"text": "\u201cHmmm,\u201d said Mr. Ollivander, giving Hagrid a piercing look. \u201cWell, now \u2014 Mr. Potter. Let me see.\u201d He pulled a long tape measure with silver markings out of his pocket. \u201cWhich is your wand arm?\u201d"}
{"text": "\u201cEr \u2014 well, I\u2019m right-handed,\u201d said Harry."}
{"text": "\u201cHold out your arm. That\u2019s it.\u201d He measured Harry from shoulder to finger, then wrist to elbow, shoulder to floor, knee to armpit and round his head. As he measured, he said, \u201cEvery Ollivander wand has a core of a powerful magical substance, Mr. Potter. We use unicorn hairs, phoenix tail feathers, and the heartstrings of dragons. No two Ollivander wands are the same, just as no two unicorns, dragons, or phoenixes are quite the same. And of course, you will never get such good results with another wizard\u2019s wand.\u201d"}
{"text": "Harry suddenly realized that the tape measure, which was measuring between his nostrils, was doing this on its own. Mr. Ollivander was flitting around the shelves, taking down boxes."}
{"text": "\u201cThat will do,\u201d he said, and the tape measure crumpled into a heap on the floor. \u201cRight then, Mr. Potter. Try this one. Beechwood and dragon heartstring. Nine inches. Nice and flexible. just take it and give it a wave.\u201d"}
{"text": "Harry took the wand and (feeling foolish) waved it around a bit, but Mr. Ollivander snatched it out of his hand almost at once."}
{"text": "\u201cMaple and phoenix feather. Seven inches. Quite whippy. Try \u2014\u201d"}
{"text": "Harry tried \u2014 but he had hardly raised the wand when it, too, was snatched back by Mr. Ollivander."}
{"text": "\u201cNo, no \u2014 here, ebony and unicorn hair, eight and a half inches, springy. Go on, go on, try it out.\u201d"}
{"text": "Harry tried. And tried. He had no idea what Mr. Ollivander was waiting for. The pile of tried wands was mounting higher and higher on the spindly chair, but the more wands Mr. Ollivander pulled from the shelves, the happier he seemed to become."}
{"text": "\u201cTricky customer, eh? Not to worry, we\u2019ll find the perfect match here somewhere \u2014 I wonder, now \u2014 yes, why not \u2014 unusual combination \u2014 holly and phoenix feather, eleven inches, nice and supple.\u201d"}
{"text": "Harry took the wand. He felt a sudden warmth in his fingers. He raised the wand above his head, brought it swishing down through the dusty air and a stream of red and gold sparks shot from the end like a firework, throwing dancing spots of light on to the walls. Hagrid whooped and clapped and Mr. Ollivander cried, \u201cOh, bravo! Yes, indeed, oh, very good. Well, well, well\u2026how curious\u2026how very curious\u2026\u201d"}
{"text": "He put Harry\u2019s wand back into its box and wrapped it in brown paper, still muttering, \u201cCurious\u2026curious\u2026"}
{"text": "\u201cSorry,\u201d said Harry, \u201cbut what\u2019s curious?\u201d"}
{"text": "Mr. Ollivander fixed Harry with his pale stare."}
{"text": "\u201cI remember every wand I\u2019ve ever sold, Mr. Potter. Every single wand. It so happens that the phoenix whose tail feather is in your wand, gave another feather \u2014 just one other. It is very curious indeed that you should be destined for this wand when its brother \u2014 why, its brother gave you that scar.\u201d"}
{"text": "Harry swallowed."}
{"text": "\u201cYes, thirteen-and-a-half inches. Yew. Curious indeed how these things happen. The wand chooses the wizard, remember\u2026I think we must expect great things from you, Mr. Potter\u2026.After all, He-Who-Must-Not-Be-Named did great things \u2014 terrible, yes, but great.\u201d"}
{"text": "Harry shivered. He wasn\u2019t sure he liked Mr. Ollivander too much. He paid seven gold Galleons for his wand, and Mr. Ollivander bowed them from his shop."}
{"text": "The late afternoon sun hung low in the sky as Harry and Hagrid made their way back down Diagon Alley, back through the wall, back through the Leaky Cauldron, now empty. Harry didn\u2019t speak at all as they walked down the road; he didn\u2019t even notice how much people were gawking at them on the Underground, laden as they were with all their funny-shaped packages, with the snowy owl asleep in its cage on Harry\u2019s lap. Up another escalator, out into Paddington station; Harry only realized where they were when Hagrid tapped him on the shoulder."}
{"text": "\u201cGot time fer a bite to eat before yer train leaves,\u201d he said."}
{"text": "He bought Harry a hamburger and they sat down on plastic seats to eat them. Harry kept looking around. Everything looked so strange, somehow."}
{"text": "\u201cYou all right, Harry? Yer very quiet,\u201d said Hagrid."}
{"text": "Harry wasn\u2019t sure he could explain. He\u2019d just had the best birthday of his life \u2014 and yet \u2014 he chewed his hamburger, trying to find the words."}
{"text": "\u201cEveryone thinks I\u2019m special,\u201d he said at last. \u201cAll those people in the Leaky Cauldron, Professor Quirrell, Mr. Ollivander\u2026but I don\u2019t know anything about magic at all. How can they expect great things? I\u2019m famous and I can\u2019t even remember what I\u2019m famous for.

Half terrified, half furious, they acted as though any chair with Harry in it were empty. Although this was an improvement in many ways, it did become a bit depressing after a while."}

He lay on his bed reading late into the night, Hedwig swooping in and out of the open window as she pleased. It was lucky that Aunt Petunia didn\u2019t come in to vacuum anymore, because Hedwig kept bringing back dead mice. Every night before he went to sleep, Harry ticked off another day on the piece of paper he had pinned to the wall, counting down to September the first."}

{"text": "\u201cBarking,\u201d said Uncle Vernon, \u201chowling mad, the lot of them. You\u2019ll see. You just wait. All right, we\u2019ll take you to King\u2019s Cross. We\u2019re going up to London tomorrow anyway, or I wouldn\u2019t bother.\u201d"}
{"text": "\u201cWhy are you going to London?\u201d Harry asked, trying to keep things friendly."}
{"text": "\u201cTaking Dudley to the hospital,\u201d growled Uncle Vernon. \u201cGot to have that ruddy tail removed before he goes to Smeltings.\u201d"}
{"text": "Harry woke at five o\u2019clock the next morning and was too excited and nervous to go back to sleep. He got up and pulled on his jeans because he didn\u2019t want to walk into the station in his wizard\u2019s robes \u2014 he\u2019d change on the train. He checked his Hogwarts list yet again to make sure he had everything he needed, saw that Hedwig was shut safely in her cage, and then paced the room, waiting for the Dursleys to get up. Two hours later, Harry\u2019s huge, heavy trunk had been loaded into the Dursleys\u2019 car, Aunt Petunia had talked Dudley into sitting next to Harry, and they had set off."}
{"text": "They reached King\u2019s Cross at half past ten. Uncle Vernon dumped Harry\u2019s trunk onto a cart and wheeled it into the station for him. Harry thought this was strangely kind until Uncle Vernon stopped dead, facing the platforms with a nasty grin on his face."}
{"text": "\u201cWell, there you are, boy. Platform nine \u2014 platform ten. Your platform should be somewhere in the middle, but they don\u2019t seem to have built it yet, do they?\u201d"}
{"text": "He was quite right, of course. There was a big plastic number nine over one platform and a big plastic number ten over the one next to it, and in the middle, nothing at all."}
{"text": "\u201cHave a good term,\u201d said Uncle Vernon with an even nastier smile. He left without another word. Harry turned and saw the Dursleys drive away. All three of them were laughing. Harry\u2019s mouth went rather dry. What on earth was he going to do? He was starting to attract a lot of funny looks, because of Hedwig. He\u2019d have to ask someone."}
{"text": "He stopped a passing guard, but didn\u2019t dare mention platform nine and three-quarters. The guard had never heard of Hogwarts and when Harry couldn\u2019t even tell him what part of the country it was in, he started to get annoyed, as though Harry was being stupid on purpose. Getting desperate, Harry asked for the train that left at eleven o\u2019clock, but the guard said there wasn\u2019t one. In the end the guard strode away, muttering about time wasters. Harry was now trying hard not to panic. According to the large clock over the arrivals board, he had ten minutes left to get on the train to Hogwarts and he had no idea how to do it; he was stranded in the middle of a station with a trunk he could hardly lift, a pocket full of wizard money, and a large owl."}
{"text": "Hagrid must have forgotten to tell him something you had to do, like tapping the third brick on the left to get into Diagon Alley. He wondered if he should get out his wand and start tapping the ticket inspector\u2019s stand between platforms nine and ten."}
{"text": "At that moment a group of people passed just behind him and he caught a few words of what they were saying."}
{"text": "\u201c\u2014 packed with Muggles, of course \u2014\u201d"}
{"text": "Harry swung round. The speaker was a plump woman who was talking to four boys, all with flaming red hair. Each of them was pushing a trunk like Harry\u2019s in front of him \u2014 and they had an owl."}
{"text": "Heart hammering, Harry pushed his cart after them. They stopped and so did he, just near enough to hear what they were saying."}
{"text": "\u201cNow, what\u2019s the platform number?\u201d said the boys\u2019 mother."}
{"text": "\u201cNine and three-quarters!\u201d piped a small girl, also red-headed, who was holding her hand, \u201cMom, can\u2019t I go\u2026\u201d"}

{"text": "What looked like the oldest boy marched toward platforms nine and ten. Harry watched, careful not to blink in case he missed it \u2014 but just as the boy reached the dividing barrier between the two platforms, a large crowd of tourists came swarming in front of him and by the time the last backpack had cleared away, the boy had vanished."}
{"text": "\u201cFred, you next,\u201d the plump woman said."}
{"text": "\u201cI\u2019m not Fred, I\u2019m George,\u201d said the boy. \u201cHonestly, woman, you call yourself our mother? Can\u2019t you tell I\u2019m George?\u201d"}
{"text": "\u201cSorry, George, dear.\u201d"}
{"text": "\u201cOnly joking, I am Fred,\u201d said the boy, and off he went. His twin called after him to hurry up, and he must have done so, because a second later, he had gone \u2014 but how had he done it?"}
{"text": "Now the third brother was walking briskly toward the barrier he was almost there \u2014 and then, quite suddenly, he wasn\u2019t anywhere."}
{"text": "There was nothing else for it."}
{"text": "\u201cExcuse me,\u201d Harry said to the plump woman."}
{"text": "\u201cHello, dear,\u201d she said. \u201cFirst time at Hogwarts? Ron\u2019s new, too.\u201d"}
{"text": "She pointed at the last and youngest of her sons. He was tall, thin, and gangling, with freckles, big hands and feet, and a long nose."}
{"text": "\u201cYes,\u201d said Harry. \u201cThe thing is \u2014 the thing is, I don\u2019t know how to \u2014\u201d"}
{"text": "\u201cHow to get onto the platform?\u201d she said kindly, and Harry nodded."}
{"text": "\u201cNot to worry,\u201d she said. \u201cAll you have to do is walk straight at the barrier between platforms nine and ten. Don\u2019t stop and don\u2019t be scared you\u2019ll crash into it, that\u2019s very important. Best do it at a bit of a run if you\u2019re nervous. Go on, go now before Ron.\u201d"}
{"text": "\u201cEr \u2014 okay,\u201d said Harry."}
{"text": "He pushed his trolley around and stared at the barrier. It looked very solid."}
{"text": "He started to walk toward it. People jostled him on their way to platforms nine and ten. Harry walked more quickly. He was going to smash right into that barrier and then he\u2019d be in trouble \u2014 leaning forward on his cart, he broke into a heavy run \u2014 the barrier was coming nearer and nearer \u2014 he wouldn\u2019t be able to stop \u2014 the cart was out of control \u2014 he was a foot away \u2014 he closed his eyes ready for the crash \u2014"}
{"text": "It didn\u2019t come\u2026he kept on running\u2026he opened his eyes. A scarlet steam engine was waiting next to a platform packed with people. A sign overhead said Hogwarts\u2019 Express, eleven o\u2019clock. Harry looked behind him and saw a wrought-iron archway where the barrier had been, with the words Platform Nine and Three-Quarters on it, He had done it."}
{"text": "Smoke from the engine drifted over the heads of the chattering crowd, while cats of every color wound here and there between their legs. Owls hooted to one another in a disgruntled sort of way over the babble and the scraping of heavy trunks."}
{"text": "The first few carriages were already packed with students, some hanging out of the window to talk to their families, some fighting over seats. Harry pushed his cart off down the platform in search of an empty seat. He passed a round-faced boy who was saying, \u201cGran, I\u2019ve lost my toad again.\u201d"}
{"text": "\u201cOh, Neville,\u201d he heard the old woman sigh."}
{"text": "A boy with dreadlocks was surrounded by a small crowd."}
{"text": "\u201cGive us a look, Lee, go on.\u201d"}
{"text": "The boy lifted the lid of a box in his arms, and the people around him shrieked and yelled as something inside poked out a long, hairy leg."}
{"text": "Harry pressed on through the crowd until he found an empty compartment near the end of the train. He put Hedwig inside first and then started to shove and heave his trunk toward the train door. He tried to lift it up the steps but could hardly raise one end and twice he dropped it painfully on his foot."}
{"text": "\u201cWant a hand?\u201d It was one of the red-haired twins he\u2019d followed through the barrier."}
{"text": "\u201cYes, please,\u201d Harry panted."}
{"text": "\u201cOy, Fred! C\u2019mere and help!\u201d"}
{"text": "With the twins\u2019 help, Harry\u2019s trunk was at last tucked away in a corner of the compartment."}
{"text": "\u201cThanks,\u201d said Harry, pushing his sweaty hair out of his eyes."}
{"text": "\u201cWhat\u2019s that?\u201d said one of the twins suddenly, pointing at Harry\u2019s lightning scar."}
{"text": "\u201cBlimey,\u201d said the other twin. \u201cAre you \u2014?\u201d"}
{"text": "\u201cHe is,\u201d said the first twin. \u201cAren\u2019t you?\u201d he added to Harry."}
{"text": "\u201cWhat?\u201d said Harry."}
{"text": "\u201cHarry Potter.\u201d chorused the twins."}
{"text": "\u201cOh, him,\u201d said Harry. \u201cI mean, yes, I am.\u201d"}
{"text": "The two boys gawked at him, and Harry felt himself turning red. Then, to his relief, a voice came floating in through the train\u2019s open door."}
{"text": "\u201cFred? George? Are you there?\u201d"}
{"text": "\u201cComing, Mom.\u201d"}
{"text": "With a last look at Harry, the twins hopped off the train."}
{"text": "Harry sat down next to the window where, half hidden, he could watch the red-haired family on the platform and hear what they were saying. Their mother had just taken out her handkerchief."}
{"text": "\u201cRon, you\u2019ve got something on your nose.\u201d"}
{"text": "The youngest boy tried to jerk out of the way, but she grabbed him and began rubbing the end of his nose."}
{"text": "\u201cMom \u2014 geroff\u201d He wriggled free."}
{"text": "\u201cAaah, has ickle Ronnie got somefink on his nosie?\u201d said one of the twins."}
{"text": "\u201cShut up,\u201d said Ron."}
{"text": "\u201cWhere\u2019s Percy?\u201d said their mother."}
{"text": "\u201cHe\u2019s coming now.\u201d"}
{"text": "The oldest boy came striding into sight. He had already changed into his billowing black Hogwarts robes, and Harry noticed a shiny silver badge on his chest with the letter P on it."}
{"text": "\u201cCan\u2019t stay long, Mother,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m up front, the prefects have got two compartments to themselves \u2014\u201d"}
{"text": "\u201cOh, are you a prefect, Percy?\u201d said one of the twins, with an air of great surprise. \u201cYou should have said something, we had no idea.\u201d"}
{"text": "\u201cHang on, I think I remember him saying something about it,\u201d said the other twin. \u201cOnce \u2014\u201d"}

{"text": "\u201cHow come Percy gets new robes, anyway?\u201d said one of the twins."}
{"text": "\u201cBecause he\u2019s a prefect,\u201d said their mother fondly. \u201cAll right, dear, well, have a good term \u2014 send me an owl when you get there.\u201d"}
{"text": "She kissed Percy on the cheek and he left. Then she turned to the twins."}
{"text": "\u201cNow, you two \u2014 this year, you behave yourselves. If I get one more owl telling me you\u2019ve \u2014 you\u2019ve blown up a toilet or \u2014\u201d"}
{"text": "\u201cBlown up a toilet? We\u2019ve never blown up a toilet.\u201d"}

{"text": "\u201cDon\u2019t worry, ickle Ronniekins is safe with us.\u201d"}
{"text": "\u201cShut up,\u201d said Ron again. He was almost as tall as the twins already and his nose was still pink where his mother had rubbed it."}
{"text": "\u201cHey, Mom, guess what? Guess who we just met on the train?\u201d"}
{"text": "Harry leaned back quickly so they couldn\u2019t see him looking."}
{"text": "\u201cYou know that black-haired boy who was near us in the station? Know who he is?\u201d"}
{"text": "\u201cWho?\u201d"}
{"text": "\u201cHarry Potter!\u201d"}

{"text": "\u201cYou\u2019ve already seen him, Ginny, and the poor boy isn\u2019t something you goggle at in a zoo. Is he really, Fred? How do you know?\u201d"}

{"text": "\u201cPoor dear \u2014 no wonder he was alone, I wondered. He was ever so polite when he asked how to get onto the platform.\u201d"}
{"text": "\u201cNever mind that, do you think he remembers what You-Know-Who looks like?\u201d"}
{"text": "Their mother suddenly became very stern."}
{"text": "\u201cI forbid you to ask him, Fred. No, don\u2019t you dare. As though he needs reminding of that on his first day at school.\u201d"}
{"text": "\u201cAll right, keep your hair on.\u201d"}
{"text": "A whistle sounded."}
{"text": "\u201cHurry up!\u201d their mother said, and the three boys clambered onto the train. They leaned out of the window for her to kiss them good-bye, and their younger sister began to cry."}
{"text": "\u201cDon\u2019t, Ginny, we\u2019ll send you loads of owls.\u201d"}

{"text": "\u201cGeorge!\u201d"}
{"text": "\u201cOnly joking, Mom.\u201d"}
{"text": "The train began to move. Harry saw the boys\u2019 mother waving and their sister, half laughing, half crying, running to keep up with the train until it gathered too much speed, then she fell back and waved."}
{"text": "Harry watched the girl and her mother disappear as the train rounded the corner. Houses flashed past the window. Harry felt a great leap of excitement. He didn\u2019t know what he was going to \u2014 but it had to be better than what he was leaving behind."}
{"text": "The door of the compartment slid open and the youngest redheaded boy came in."}
{"text": "\u201cAnyone sitting there?\u201d he asked, pointing at the seat opposite Harry. \u201cEverywhere else is full.\u201d"}
{"text": "Harry shook his head and the boy sat down. He glanced at Harry and then looked quickly out of the window, pretending he hadn\u2019t looked. Harry saw he still had a black mark on his nose."}

{"text": "The twins were back."}

{"text": "\u201cBye,\u201d said Harry and Ron. The twins slid the compartment door shut behind them."}
{"text": "\u201cAre you really Harry Potter?\u201d Ron blurted out."}
{"text": "Harry nodded."}
{"text": "\u201cOh \u2014 well, I thought it might be one of Fred and George\u2019s jokes,\u201d said Ron. \u201cAnd have you really got \u2014 you know\u2026\u201d"}
{"text": "He pointed at Harry\u2019s forehead."}

{"text": "\u201cWell \u2014 I remember a lot of green light, but nothing else.\u201d"}
{"text": "\u201cWow,\u201d said Ron. He sat and stared at Harry for a few moments, then, as though he had suddenly realized what he was doing, he looked quickly out of the window again."}
{"text": "\u201cAre all your family wizards?\u201d asked Harry, who found Ron just as interesting as Ron found him."}
{"text": "\u201cEr \u2014 Yes, I think so,\u201d said Ron. \u201cI think Mom\u2019s got a second cousin who\u2019s an accountant, but we never talk about him.\u201d"}
{"text": "\u201cSo you must know loads of magic already.\u201d"}
{"text": "The Weasleys were clearly one of those old wizarding families the pale boy in Diagon Alley had talked about."}

{"text": "\u201cFive,\u201d said Ron. For some reason, he was looking gloomy. \u201cI\u2019m the sixth in our family to go to Hogwarts. You could say I\u2019ve got a lot to live up to. Bill and Charlie have already left \u2014 Bill was head boy and Charlie was captain of Quidditch. Now Percy\u2019s a prefect. Fred and George mess around a lot, but they still get really good marks and everyone thinks they\u2019re really funny. Everyone expects me to do as well as the others, but if I do, it\u2019s no big deal, because they did it first. You never get anything new, either, with five brothers. I\u2019ve got Bill\u2019s old robes, Charlie\u2019s old wand, and Percy\u2019s old rat.\u201d"}

{"text": "Ron\u2019s ears went pink. He seemed to think he\u2019d said too much, because he went back to staring out of the window."}
{"text": "Harry didn\u2019t think there was anything wrong with not being able to afford an owl. After all, he\u2019d never had any money in his life until a month ago, and he told Ron so, all about having to wear Dudley\u2019s old clothes and never getting proper birthday presents. This seemed to cheer Ron up."}
{"text": "\u201c\u2026and until Hagrid told me, I didn\u2019t know anything about being a wizard or about my parents or Voldemort \u2014\u201d"}

{"text": "\u201cWhat?\u201d said Harry."}
{"text": "\u201cYou said You-Know-Who\u2019s name!\u201d said Ron, sounding both shocked and impressed. \u201cI\u2019d have thought you, of all people \u2014\u201d"}
{"text": "\u201cI\u2019m not trying to be brave or anything, saying the name,\u201d said Harry, \u201cI just never knew you shouldn\u2019t. See what I mean?

{"text": "Around half past twelve there was a great clattering outside in the corridor and a smiling, dimpled woman slid back their door and said, \u201cAnything off the cart, dears?\u201d"}
{"text": "Harry, who hadn\u2019t had any breakfast, leapt to his feet, but Ron\u2019s ears went pink again and he muttered that he\u2019d brought sandwiches. Harry went out into the corridor."}
{"text": "He had never had any money for candy with the Dursleys, and now that he had pockets rattling with gold and silver he was ready to buy as many Mars Bars as he could carry \u2014 but the woman didn\u2019t have Mars Bars. What she did have were Bettie Bott\u2019s Every Flavor Beans, Drooble\u2019s Best Blowing Gum, Chocolate Frogs. Pumpkin Pasties, Cauldron Cakes, Licorice Wands, and a number of other strange things Harry had never seen in his life. Not wanting to miss anything, he got some of everything and paid the woman eleven silver Sickles and seven bronze Knuts."}

{"text": "\u201cWell, you can\u2019t expect him to hang around all day,\u201d said Ron. \u201cHe\u2019ll be back. No, I\u2019ve got Morgana again and I\u2019ve got about six of her\u2026do you want it? You can start collecting.\u201d"}
{"text": "Ron\u2019s eyes strayed to the pile of Chocolate Frogs waiting to be unwrapped."}
{"text": "\u201cHelp yourself,\u201d said Harry. \u201cBut in, you know, the Muggle world, people just stay put in photos.\u201d"}
{"text": "\u201cDo they? What, they don\u2019t move at all?\u201d Ron sounded amazed. \u201cWeird!\u201d"}
{"text": "Harry stared as Dumbledore sidled back into the picture on his card and gave him a small smile. Ron was more interested in eating the frogs than looking at the Famous Witches and Wizards cards, but Harry couldn\u2019t keep his eyes off them. Soon he had not only Dumbledore and Morgana, but Hengist of Woodcroft, Alberic Grunnion, Circe, Paracelsus, and Merlin. He finally tore his eyes away from the Druidess Cliodna, who was scratching her nose, to open a bag of Bertie Bott\u2019s Every Flavor Beans."}
{"text": "\u201cYou want to be careful with those,\u201d Ron warned Harry. \u201cWhen they say every flavor, they mean every flavor \u2014 you know, you get all the ordinary ones like chocolate and peppermint and marmalade, but then you can get spinach and liver and tripe. George reckons he had a booger-flavored one once.\u201d"}
{"text": "Ron picked up a green bean, looked at it carefully, and bit into a corner."}
{"text": "\u201cBleaaargh \u2014 see? Sprouts.\u201d"}
{"text": "They had a good time eating the Every Flavor Beans. Harry got toast, coconut, baked bean, strawberry, curry, grass, coffee, sardine, and was even brave enough to nibble the end off a funny gray one Ron wouldn\u2019t touch, which turned out to be pepper."}
{"text": "The countryside now flying past the window was becoming wilder. The neat fields had gone. Now there were woods, twisting rivers, and dark green hills."}
{"text": "There was a knock on the door of their compartment and the round-faced boy Harry had passed on platform nine and three-quarters came in. He looked tearful."}
{"text": "\u201cSorry,\u201d he said, \u201cbut have you seen a toad at all?\u201d"}
{"text": "When they shook their heads, he wailed, \u201cI\u2019ve lost him! He keeps getting away from me!\u201d"}
{"text": "\u201cHe\u2019ll turn up,\u201d said Harry."}
{"text": "\u201cYes,\u201d said the boy miserably. \u201cWell, if you see him\u2026\u201d"}
{"text": "He left."}
{"text": "\u201cDon\u2019t know why he\u2019s so bothered,\u201d said Ron. \u201cIf I\u2019d brought a toad I\u2019d lose it as quick as I could. Mind you, I brought Scabbers, so I can\u2019t talk.\u201d"}
{"text": "The rat was still snoozing on Ron\u2019s lap."}
{"text": "\u201cHe might have died and you wouldn\u2019t know the difference,\u201d said Ron in disgust. \u201cI tried to turn him yellow yesterday to make him more interesting, but the spell didn\u2019t work. I\u2019ll show you, look\u2026\u201d"}
{"text": "He rummaged around in his trunk and pulled out a very battered-looking wand. It was chipped in places and something white was glinting at the end."}
{"text": "\u201cUnicorn hair\u2019s nearly poking out. Anyway \u2014\u201d"}
